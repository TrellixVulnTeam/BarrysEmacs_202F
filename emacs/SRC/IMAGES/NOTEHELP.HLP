1 ADD (A)

 Adds new elements to Emacs Notes conferences or your Notebook.

2 ENTRY (Ae)

 Adds a  new entry for a conference to your Notebook. This tells Emacs
 Notes  that  you  want  to  keep  track  of  the  discussion  in this
 conference.

  Binding:
	Ae

  Format:
	Notefile name:		notefile-name
	Entry name:		entry-name
	Classes:		class-name[,...]
	Personal name:		personal-name

3 Parameters
Entry name:	entry-name

 Specifies the entry name for a conference you add to your Notebook.

 If you  specify a conference name as the parameter with the ADD ENTRY
 command,  Emacs  Notes uses the conference name as the entry name. If
 you  leave  this  field  blank it is defaulted to the filename of the
 notefile spec.

 If you  do  not  want  to  use the conference name as the entry name,
 specify  the  entry  name as the parameter with the ADD ENTRY command
 and specify the conference name with the /FILE qualifier.

 To add  a conference on a remote node, you must include the node name
 in the notefile specification.

Classes: class-name[,...]

 Names the  Notebook classes to which the entry is to belong. Separate
 multiple class names with commas. The default is the current class.

 You must separate names with commas.

 You can  also  use  the CLASSES qualifier to add an existing entry to
 one  or  more  classes.  If  you specify a class that does not exist,
 Emacs  Notes  automatically  creates the class. The ADD ENTRY/CLASSES
 command is convenient to use when an entry already belongs to several
 classes;  with the MODIFY ENTRY/CLASSES command, you have to list the
 classes  to  which  the  entry  currently belongs, as well as the new
 ones, to add an existing entry to new classes.

Notefile name: notefile-name

 Specifies the  conference  you want to add to your Notebook. Use this
 qualifier when you specify the entry name as the parameter.

Personal name:	personal-name

 Specifies the personal name to be used when this conference is used.
 
3 Command_Description

 The "Ae", ADD ENTRY, command adds a conference to one or more classes
 in  your  Notebook.  The default entry name is the file name from the
 notefile specification.

 If you  are  currently  reading  a  note  that  has the "*", shopping
 indicator, ADD ENTRY will use the conference specified in the note as
 the default filename.

 ADD ENTRY will also default the filename from the current region. Use
 the "/Ae" command to do this.

 In one  step,  you can add a conference to your Notebook and give the
 conference an entry name that is easy for you to remember and type.

 To add  a  conference that exists in the NOTES$LIBRARY directory on a
 remote node, you must include the node name with the conference name.
 To  add  a  conference  that resides in a private directory, you must
 include  the  full notefile specification (device and directory name)
 with the conference name.

 You can  use  the  CLASSES  field  to  add  the  entry to one or more
 specific  classes.  If  you  do  not specify any classes, Emacs Notes
 assumes you want to add the entry to the current class.

 Emacs Notes  does  not verify that the conference exists when you use
 the ADD ENTRY command. This is done purposely to allow you to add the
 entry  to  your  Notebook  even  if  the node on which the conference
 resides  is  unreachable  at  the  time.  Make  sure  you  spell  the
 conference name correctly.

3 Examples

Notefile name:		DSSDEV::EMACS
Entry name:		
Classes:		MAIN
Personal name:		

 Add the EMACS conference on DSSDEV:: to your notebook. The entry name
 is defaulted to EMACS.

2 KEYWORD (Ak)

 Adds a  keyword  to  the  current  or  specified  note. The specified
 keyword must be an existing keyword for the conference.

 Format:
	Note id:	note-id
	Add keywords:	keyword-name

3 Parameters
Keywords:  keyword-name

 Specifies the  keywords  you  want to add to a note. The keyword name
 must  exactly  match  a  keyword  previously  defined with the CREATE
 KEYWORD command.

Note id:	note-id

 Refers to  a single topic or reply. The default is the topic or reply
 you are currently reading.

3 Command_Description

 Use the ADD KEYWORD command to add an existing keyword to the current
 or  specified  note. If you do not specify a note, VAX Notes adds the
 keyword to the note you are currently reading.

 The keyword  name  you  specify  must  be an existing keyword for the
 conference.  In a conference that restricts the creation of keywords,
 you must have CREATE_KEYWORDS privilege to create a new keyword. In a
 conference  that  does  not  restrict  keywords, you can create a new
 keyword  with  the  CREATE  KEYWORD  command. If you have MODERATE or
 CREATE_KEYWORDS   privilege,  Emacs  Notes  automatically  creates  a
 keyword the first time you add the keyword to a note.

 You can  see  all  the keywords defined for a conference by using the
 "lk" or "\lk" LIST KEYWORDS commands.

 You can  see  all  the  keywords associated with a particular note by
 using the "ln", LIST NOTES command.

 You can  see  all  the  notes  associated with a keyword by using the
 "\dn", DIRECTORY NOTES, command and specify the keyword.

3 Examples
2 MARKER (m, Am)

 Adds a  marker to the current or specified note in the current entry.

 Format:

	Note id:
	Marker:

3 Parameters
Marker:

 Consists of a text-string that names a marker in a Notebook entry.

Note id:

 Refers to  a single topic or reply. The default is the topic or reply
 you are currently reading.

3 Command_Description

 A marker  is  a  word  or phrase that you associate with a particular
 note  so that you can refer to the note by the word or phrase instead
 of  its  note  number.  Marker  names must be unique within an entry,
 although you can use the same marker name in different entries.

 If you  do  not  specify  a  note  to be marked, Emacs Notes adds the
 marker to the note you are currently reading.

 You can  see  all  the markers you created for the current entry, and
 the  note number associated with each, by using either the LIST ENTRY
 command  or  the  "lm",  LIST MARKER, command. To see the note number
 associated  with  a  particular  marker,  use  the "/lm", LIST MARKER
 command.

 To retrieve  a note that you marked, use the READ command and specify
 the name of the marker at the note-id prompt.

 To delete  a  marker,  use  the  "Dm",  DELETE MARKER, command. (This
 deletes the marker only, not the note.)

 The "Am",  ADD  MARKER, and "m", MARK, commands are synonyms, and can
 be used interchangeably.

3 Examples
2 MEMBER (AM, Au)

 Adds a new member, or user, to the conference.

 Format:

	Username:
	Nodenames:
	Create keywords:	n
	Moderator:		n
	Mail address:

3 Parameters
Username:

 Specifies the  VAX/VMS  user  name  for  the  user you want to make a
 member of a private conference.

 When you  specify the full node::username, Emacs Notes treats this as
 though you specified ADD MEMBER username /NODES=node.

Mail address:

 Specifies a  mailing address for this member. This is useful when the
 member uses a mail system other than the VAX/VMS Mail Utility (MAIL),
 or wants to receive mail on a particular system.

Nodenames:	node-name[,...]

 Specifies the  node-names  that,  used  in  combination with the user
 name, identify this member. You must seperate a list of node names in
 names with commas.


Moderator:
Create keywords:

 Gives this  member  the  ability  to  act  as moderator or create new
 keywords  for  this  conference.  If  you  give  the  member MODERATE
 privilege, this member may issue the SET MODERATOR command.

 If you  give  the  member  CREATE_KEYWORDS privilege, this member may
 create new keywords. In a conference that restricts keyword creation,
 without  CREATE_KEYWORDS  privilege,  a  user  may  only add existing
 keywords to notes.

 A user  who  has MODERATE privilege automatically has CREATE_KEYWORDS
 privilege.

3 Command_Description

 The "AM",  ADD MEMBER, command adds a new user to the membership list
 for a private or restricted conference. You can list node names that,
 together  with  the  user  name,  identify  this  user.  Emacs  Notes
 recognizes  this  user  by  any combination of node name and the user
 name.

 In addition  to  specifying a list of node names by which to identify
 this  user,  you  can specify a mailing address, and grant privileges
 that  let  the  user  act  as  moderator  or create keywords for this
 conference.

 You can  change  a  user's  privileges, mail address, nodes, and user
 name at any time with the "MM", MODIFY MEMBER, command.

3 Examples

1 ANSWER (a)

 Enters a reply to the current topic or reply.

 Format:

	Title:
	Add keywords:
	Hide note:

2 Parameters
Title:	string

 If specified  the  string is used as the title of the note. Otherwise
 the note does not have a title.

Hide note:

 Set this  parameter to "y" if you wish the note to written and hidden
 from other member of the conference.

Add keywords:	keyword [,...]

 An optional  list  of  keywords  to  be added to the note after it is
 written.

2 Command_Description

 The "a",  ANSWER,  command  allows  you to add a reply to the current
 discussion.

 If VAX  Notes  is unable to write your reply to the conference, or if
 you  cancel  your reply the text of the reply is still in the compose
 buffer.

1 BACK (b)

 Displays the  previous  topic,  note,  or  reply  to  the one you are
 currently reading.

2 NOTE (bn)

 Displays the note previous to the one you are currently reading.

3 Command_Description

 The "bn",  BACK  NOTE,  command  displays  the  previous  note in the
 conference,  whether  you  are  reading  a topic or reply. If you are
 reading a topic, this command displays the last reply to the previous
 topic.

2 REPLY (br)

 Displays the previous reply for the current note.

3 Command_Description

 The "br",  BACK  REPLY,  command  displays the previous reply for the
 current topic. You cannot use the BACK REPLY command to move past the
 current discussion. If you are reading a topic and you issue the BACK
 REPLY command, Emacs Notes issues the message, 'No more replies'.

 You can use the KP1 key to issue this command.

2 TOPIC (Bt)

 Display the previous topic.

3 Command_Description

 The "bt",  BACK  TOPIC,  command  displays  the previous topic in the
 conference, whether you are reading a topic or reply.

 You can use the KP5 key to issue this command.

1 CLOSE (c)

 Closes the currently open conference.

2 Command_Description

 The "c",  CLOSE  command  closes  the  currently open conference, and
 returns you to your Notebook.

 The "q", QUIT, command automatically close any open conferences.

1 CREATE (C)

 Creates a conference or a keyword in a conference.

 If you  wish  to  enter a new note in an existing conference, use the
 "w", WRITE, or "a", ANSWER, commands.

2 CONFERENCE (CC)

 Creates a new conference with the name you specify.

 Format:

	Notefile name:
	Conference title:
	Restrict members:	n
	Restrict keywords:	y

3 Parameters
Notefile name:

 Specifies the  conference  that  you  want  to  create.  To  create a
 conference  on  a  remote node, you must specify the node name in the
 specification.  The  default  directory (NOTES$LIBRARY) and file type
 (.NOTE)  are  assumed. The file name portion of this specification is
 the  default  entry  name  when someone adds this conference to their
 Notebook.

Conference title:	string

 Sets the title of the conference to the string you specify.  


Restrict members:

 Specifies whether or not to restrict access.

Restrict Keywords:

 Specifies wheter or not to restrict the creation of keywords.

3 Command_Description

 The CREATE  CONFERENCE  command  lets  you create a new conference on
 your  system. When you create a conference, Emacs Notes automatically
 recognizes  you  as  a  moderator for the conference; you do not need
 special privileges to issue this command.

 Depending on  how your Emacs Notes system was installed, you may need
 special  privileges  to  create  a  conference  in  the NOTES$LIBRARY
 directory.  If  so,  you  can  create  the conference in your private
 directory and ask your system manager to move the conference into the
 NOTES$LIBRARY     directory,     using    the    command    procedure
 SYS$MANAGER:NOTES$MOVE_CONFERENCE.COM.

 You must  specify the name of the conference you want to create. This
 name  is  the default entry name when someone adds this conference to
 their Notebook.

 You can   use  the  RESTRICT  qualifier  to  control  access  to  the
 conference,  restrict  the creation of keywords to specific users, or
 both.  The  default  is to create a public conference that anyone can
 access and in which keyword creation is restricted.

 If you  decide to create a private conference (open to a select group
 of  users)  or a restricted conference (in which only certain members
 can  create  keywords),  you  must  create  a membership list for the
 conference.  The  membership  list  identifies  who  may  access  the
 conference  and  which  of these members can create keywords. You use
 the ADD MEMBER command to create the membership list.

 You can  use  the  VAX/VMS  Mail Utility (MAIL) to announce a private
 conference   to   members   only   by  issuing  the  SEND/MEMBERS  or
 FORWARD/MEMBERS  command. Emacs Notes uses the membership list like a
 MAIL distribution list. (Not yet implemented)

 You can  make  a  public conference available on a "shopping list" in
 another conference by using the "Sn", SET NOTE, command. (This method
 is not recommended for private conferences.)

 If you  want  to  add  a  new note to an existing conference, use the
 ANSWER or WRITE commands.

2 KEYWORD (Ck, CK)

 Adds a new keyword to the current conference.

 Format:

	Create keyword (keyword)

3 Parameters
keyword-name

 Names the keyword you want to create.

3 Command_Description

 The "Ck",  CREATE  KEYWORD, command allows you to create new keywords
 for  a  conference.  You  specify the name of the keyword you want to
 create.

 In a conference that restricts keyword creation, you must either be a
 moderator   or  have  CREATE_KEYWORDS  privilege  specified  in  your
 membership  record.  You  can  use the "lu", LIST USER command to see
 your membership record.

 Once you  create  a keyword, any user can add the keyword to any note
 in the conference with the ADD KEYWORD command.

 If you  are  authorized to create keywords, Emacs Notes automatically
 creates a keyword the first time you add the keyword to a note.

3 Examples

	Create keyword (keyword) TRUCKERS

   Creates the keyword TRUCKERS for this conference.

	Create keyword (keyword) MONEY_MARKET

     Cannot create keyword MONEY_MARKET

   Produces an error message in a conference that restricts keyword
   creation if you do not have CREATE_KEYWORDS (or MODERATE)
   privilege.

1 DELETE (D)

 Deletes various things.

2 ENTRY (De)

 Deletes an  entry  from your Notebook from the specified class or all
 classes.

 Format:

	Entry:
	Class:

3 Parameters
Entry:	entry-name

 Names the  entry you want to delete. If the entry is in more than one
 class,  it  is  deleted  from  the  current  class unless you specify
 another  class  with the CLASS qualifier. To delete an entry from all
 classes, use CLASS=*.

Class:	class-name

 Specifies a  single class from which to delete the entry. The default
 is  to  delete  the entry from the current class. To delete the entry
 from all classes, use the wildcard character (*) as the class-name.

3 Command_Description

 The "De",  DELETE ENTRY, command deletes an entry from your Notebook.
 You must specify the name of the entry you want to delete.

 If the  entry  is in more than one class, Emacs Notes deletes it from
 the  current  class  unless you specify a particular class. To delete
 the entry from all classes, issue the command:

	Entry:	entry-name
	Class:	*

 To delete  all  entries  in  a  class  (that  is, to delete the class
 itself), issue the command:

	Entry:	*
	Class:	class-name

 If you  issue  the command DELETE ENTRY * /CLASS=FOO, and some of the
 entries were in both class FOO and class MAIN but others were only in
 FOO, the latter do not get deleted from the Notebook, but they do not
 belong  to  any  classes and will not be visible unless you issue the
 command DIRECTORY/NOTEBOOK/CLASSES=*.

3 Examples
     Notes> DELETE ENTRY FOOTBALL /CLASS=*

   Deletes the entry FOOTBALL from all classes.

     Notes> DELETE ENTRY /CLASS=GAMES ALIENS

   Deletes the entry ALIENS from the class GAMES only.

     Notes> DELETE ENTRY * /CLASS=MISC

 Format:

	Note id:
	Delete keywords:

3 Parameters
Delete keywords:	keyword-name [,...]

 Names the keywords you want to delete.

Note id:	note-id

 Specifies a  single  topic  or reply. The default is the note you are
 currently reading.

3 Command_Description

 The "Dk",  DELETE  KEYWORD, command deletes a keyword from a note. If
 you  do  not specify a note, Emacs Notes deletes the keyword from the
 current note.

 To use  the /ALL qualifier to delete the keyword from all notes (and,
 therefore,  delete  the  keyword),  you  must  be a moderator for the
 conference  or have CREATE_KEYWORDS privilege. (Not implemented yet).

3 Qualifiers
/ALL

 Specifies that the keyword is to be deleted from all notes. This also
 causes  the keyword itself to be deleted. You must be a moderator for
 the conference to use this qualifier.

3 Examples
     Notes> DELETE KEYWORD MRP

   Deletes the keyword MRP from the current note.

     Notes> DELETE KEYWORD KIDS 2.9

   Deletes the keyword KIDS from note 2.9.

     Notes> DELETE KEYWORD /ALL SUGAR

   Deletes the keyword SUGAR from all notes, and deletes the keyword
   SUGAR.

2 MARKER (Dm)

 Deletes a marker from the current entry.

 Format:

	Marker:
	Entry:

3 Parameters
Marker:		marker-name

 Names the marker you want to delete.

Entry:		entry-name

 Names the  entry  that  the  marker  is to be deleted from. The entry
 is defaulted where possible.

3 Command_Description

 The "Dm",  DELETE  MARKER,  command deletes a marker from the current
 entry only. If you used this marker name in another entry, the marker
 remains  in that entry. You must specify the name of the marker to be
 deleted.

3 Examples
     Notes> DELETE MARKER FORGET_ME_NOT

   Deletes the marker FORGET_ME_NOT from the current entry.

2 MEMBER or USER (Du)

 Deletes a  member, user, from the membership list for the conference.

 Format:

	Delete member:

3 Parameters
Delete member:	username

 Specifies the  member  to  be deleted. Do not specify a node with the
 user name.

3 Command_Description

 The "Du",  DELETE  USER, command deletes a member from the membership
 list.  You  must  specify  the  user  name;  the  user's  node is not
 required.

 To use the DELETE USER command, you must have moderator privilege and
 must  have  first  issued  the  SET  MODERATOR command to enable that
 privilege.

 You can delete one member at a time.

3 Examples
     Notes> DELETE MEMBER MITCHELL

   Deletes user MITCHELL from the membership list for this
   conference.
2 NOTE (Dn)

 Deletes a topic or reply from the conference.

 Format:

	Note id:

3 Parameters
Note id:	note-ID

 Specifies a  single topic or reply. The default is the topic or reply
 you are currently reading.

3 Command_Description

 The "Dn", DELETE NOTE, command deletes the current or specified note.

 If you  are  a moderator for the conference, you can delete any note.
 Otherwise, you can delete only your own topics and replies.

 To determine whether you are authorized to delete a note, Emacs Notes
 checks  the  combination  of  the node name and the author name. In a
 public  conference,  the node name in the note heading must match the
 node  you  are  on in order for you to delete your note. In a private
 conference,  as  long  as  you are on one of the nodes listed in your
 membership record, you can delete your note.

3 Examples
     Notes> DELETE

   Deletes the current note.

     Notes> DELETE NOTE 2.1

   Deletes note 2.1.

1 DIRECTORY (d)

 Displays a directory of things.

2 NOTES (dn, \dn)

 Format:

	Note-id:
	String:
	Author:
	Since:
	Before:
	Title:
	Unseen:		n
	Keyword:

3 Command_Description

 The DIRECTORY command displays a directory of the current conference.
 If  no conference is open, DIRECTORY lists the entries in the current
 class in your Notebook.

 You can  optionally  specify  a  range  of  notes  to  include in the
 directory,  and  selectively display notes you have or have not seen,
 or those entered by a certain author, having a certain word or phrase
 in  the  title,  entered  on  a  particular  date, having one or more
 specific keywords, or a combination of these.

 The default display sequence is in descending order.  You can display
 the directory in ascending order by specifying the range of notes
 from lowest to highest.

 You can  display a note listed in the directory by moving the pointer
 to  the  note  and pressing the "r", READ or SELECT key. You can move
 the pointer forward with KP2, and backward with KP5.


3 Parameters
Note id:	note-range

 Specifies a  range  of notes. If no range is specified, the directory
 is centered around the current note. (Not implemented yet)

Author:		username

 Lists only  notes  written  by  the  specified  user (author). If you
 include  a  node name with the user name, the directory is limited to
 that specific combination.

3  Examples
     Notes> DIR 6.*-25.*

   Lists topics and replies, starting with note 6.0 and ending with
   the last reply to topic 25.  (This is the same as typing
   DIR /ALL 6-25.)

     Notes> DIR 10-20

   Lists topics in ascending order, starting with note 10 and ending
   with note 20.

     Notes> DIR 20-10

   Lists topics in descending order, starting with note 20 and ending
   with note 10.

     Notes> DIR /TITLE="BUG" /AUTHOR=CHARLIE

   Lists notes written by user CHARLIE that have the word BUG in the
   title.

     Notes> DIR /SINCE=YESTERDAY 100-9999

   Lists notes written since yesterday, starting with note 100 and
   ending with the last note in the conference.

     Notes> DIR /UNSEEN /BUFFER=DIRECTORY

   DIRECTORY.  To see the listing, issue the command EVE BUFFER
   DIRECTORY.

     Notes> DIR /KEYWORD=NITROGLYCERIN

   Lists notes that have the keyword NITROGLYCERIN.

2 CONFERENCES (dC)

 Displays a  directory  of the conferences on the current or specified
 node.

                        NOTE

 Currently this  command  is  disable  due to a bug in the Emacs Notes
 which causes the directory to hang indefinitly.

3 Parameters
node-name

 Specifies the node for which you want a directory of conferences. The
 default is the node you are currently on.

3 Command_Description

 The "dC",  DIRECTORY  of CONFERENCES, command displays a directory of
 the  conferences  on  the  specified node. Unless you specify another
 another  node,  you  get  a listing of the conferences on the current
 node. (The default directory, NOTES$LIBRARY, is assumed.)

 To see a directory of the conferences in a private directory, specify
 the device name and directory name.

 The conference  directory  shows the title, notice, and number of new
 notes  for conferences you are allowed to access, and indicates which
 conferences you are not allowed to access.

 When the directory of available conferences is displayed, you can add
 a  conference to your Notebook by moving the pointer and pressing the
 SELECT  key.  You  move  the  pointer  forward  with the KP2 key, and
 backward with the KP5 key.

                                 NOTE

      When you request a listing of conferences in someone's
      private directory, that person's Notebook is listed as
      a conference with the name NOTES$NOTEBOOK.  DIGITAL
      recommends that you do not attempt to access or add
      notes to a Notebook.

3 Examples
     Notes> DIRECTORY /CONFERENCES

   Displays a listing of the conferences on the current node.

     Notes> DIRECTORY /CONFERENCES NODE1

   Displays a listing of the conferences on node NODE1.

     Notes> DIRECTORY /CONFERENCES DISK$:[HARVEY]

   Displays a listing of the conferences in user HARVEY's private
   directory on device DISK$:.

     Notes> DIRECTORY /CONFERENCES /BUFFER=DIR HALO

   Puts the directory of conferences on node HALO into a buffer named
   DIR.  You can view the directory listing at any time during the
   current Emacs Notes session by issuing the command EVE BUFFER DIR,
   instead of having to reissue the DIRECTORY /CONFERENCES command.

     Notes> DIR /CONFERENCES /OUTPUT=DIR.LIS MYVAX

   Puts the directory of conferences on the node MYVAX into an output
   file named DIR.LIS.

2 ENTRIES (de)

 Displays a  listing  of  the  entries  in  the  current class in your
 Notebook.

 See also  "\lc", LIST CLASSES, which gives a directory of entries for
 ever class.

3 Command_Description

 The "de",  DIRECTORY ENTRIES, command displays a directory listing of
 the requested entries in your Notebook.

 When the  directory listing is displayed on your screen, you can open
 an  entry by moving the pointer to the entry you want and issuing the
 "o",  OPEN,  command  (or  pressing  the SELECT key). You can use the
 following keys to move the pointer:

        [ - select previous entry
        ] - select next entry

1 EXIT (q)

 Exits from Emacs Notes.

2 Command_Description

 The "q",  EXIT,  command exits from the Emacs notes package. Any open
 conference is closed before exiting.

 The "\q"  command  suspends the current notes seesion. You can return
 to the suspended session with the "ESC-x notes" command.

1 EXTRACT (e)

 Creates a  text file in your current default directory containing the
 specified note or range of notes.

   Format:
	Note-id:
	Mark as seen:
	File:

	String:
	Author:
	Since:
	Before:
	Title:
	Unseen:
	Keyword:


2 Command_Description

 The "e",  EXTRACT,  command  creates a text file containing the notes
 you  specify.  You  must  specify  the name of the output file as the
 first  parameter in the command. Use the optional second parameter to
 specify  the range of notes to extract. If no range is specified, VAX
 Notes extracts only the note you are currently reading.

 The following qualifiers should only be used when you specify a range
 of notes:

        AUTHOR          SINCE
        BEFORE          TITLE
        KEYWORD         UNSEEN
        SEEN

2 Parameters

File:		output-file

 Specifies the  output  file in which to store the specified notes. If
 you do not specify an output file the extracted notes are left in the
 extraction buffer.

Buffer:		buffer-name

 Specifies the  buffer  to  extact  the  notes  into.  By  default the
 notes-extract buffer is used.

Note id:	note-range

 Specifies the range of notes to be extracted. The default is the note
 you are currently reading.

Author:		username

 Lists only  notes  written  by  the  specified  user (author). If you
 include  a  node name with the user name, the directory is limited to
 that specific combination.

Before:		date-time

 Lists only   notes   entered  before  the  date-time  specified.  The
 date-time can be any valid VAX/VMS date-time specification.

Keyword:	keyword-name

1 FORWARD

 Forwards the note you are reading as a mail message to someone.

 Not implemented yet.

2 Command_Description

 The FORWARD  command  forwards  a  copy of the note you are currently
 reading to someone by the VAX/VMS Mail Utility (MAIL).

 Emacs Notes  prompts you for a mail address or list of addresses. You
 specify  the  node  name  and  user  name  of the persons you want to
 receive the note; use commas to separate addressees in a list.

 If you  want  to  send a note to all members of a conference, use the
 /MEMBERS  qualifier.  Emacs  Notes  automatically uses the membership
 list as a MAIL distribution list. (If you use the /MEMBERS qualifier,
 you will not be prompted for an addressee list.)

 You can optionally choose a subject for the forwarded note. VAX Notes
 uses a default subject consisting of the conference name and location
 and the note number.

 Emacs Notes automatically gives you a chance to preface the note with
 a  message  before  forwarding  it.  You  type  your  message  in the
 NOTES$MAIL_EDIT  buffer.  To  bypass  this  option,  use  the /NOEDIT
 qualifier.

 You can  retrieve  the text of the last message you sent (with either
 the  SEND or FORWARD command) by using the /LAST qualifier. You start
 off  in the editor with your last mail message in the NOTES$EDIT_MAIL
 buffer. You can edit the text before forwarding it again.

2 Qualifiers
/HEADER (default)
/NOHEADER

 Specifies whether to include the note header at the top of the mail
 message.

/MEMBERS

 Forwards the  note to the conference members. Use this qualifier when
 you  want  to  be certain all members see a particular note. When you
 use this qualifier, you are not prompted for a list of addressees.

2 Examples
     Notes> FORWARD /NOEDIT
     Send to: FLOYD::GILMORE
     Subject:
     Default mail subject is "Notefile ORBIT::AI Note 45.3".

   Forwards a copy of note 45.3 in the AI conference to user GILMORE on
   node FLOYD, and uses the default subject as the mail subject.


     Notes> FORWARD /NOEDIT /MEMBERS
     Subject: Another opinion on the Magnum deal

   The current note is forwarded as a mail message to all members of
   this conference.
1 HELP (h)

 Displays on  your terminal the list of Emacs Notes commands for which
 on-line HELP is available.

2 Command_Description

 The HELP  command  displays on your terminal a listing of Emacs Notes
 commands for which on-line HELP is available.

 If the  word  you  type after the HELP command is one of the commands
 that  takes  an  option (ADD, CREATE, DELETE, MODIFY, SET, and LIST),
 VAX  Notes  displays the option list for the command, and prompts you
 for the option you want help on.

 Emacs Notes  also  has  on-line  HELP  for  key bindings. See the the
 section of Keybindings for details.

 To leave HELP and return to Emacs Notes, type "q".

1 KEYPAD

2 SELECT

  SELECT, E4, Keypad 7 (VT100 terminals)

 SELECT allows you to make a selection from a directory listing, or to
 select  a conference that is linked to a note, and add the conference
 to your Notebook.

 A pointer appears in the first column of a directory listing. You can
 move  the  pointer  up  (using  KP5)  or down (using KP2) through the
 listing.  When  the pointer is at the item you want, press the SELECT
 key to select the item.

 When viewing  a listing of entries in your Notebook, you can move the
 pointer  to  the  next entry with a non-zero Unseen count by pressing
 KP3.  You  can  move  the  pointer  back to the previous entry with a
 non-zero Unseen count by pressing KP1.

 A note that is linked to a conference has an asterisk (*) next to the
 note number in the note heading.

2 LAST_NOTE_READ

  Keypad MINUS

 LAST NOTE READ redisplays the note you were reading immediately prior
 to  the current note. This works regardless of discussion boundaries.
 For  example,  if  you  read  note  4.3,  then read note 6.5, you can
 redisplay note 4.3 by pressing LAST NOTE READ.

2 ENTER

  ENTER

 If you  are  reading  a  note, ENTER allows you to navigate through a
 conference in the following manner:

  o  If the current note continues onto another screen, the next
     screen is displayed.

  o  If you are at the end of the current note, the next reply
     is displayed.

  o  If there are no more replies, the next unseen note is displayed.


2 RETURN

  RETURN

 RETURN is  used  as the continue-operation key in Emacs Notes. If you
 are reading a note the RETURN key will display the new screen full of
 text from the note.

 If you  are doing a DIRECTORY of NOTES, "dn", RETURN with display the
 next screen full of the directory listing.

 If you prefix the RETURN key with "/" RETURN will read all of te text
 of a note or complete the requested directory of notes.

2 NEXT_UNSEEN

 and displays the next note you have not yet read. The skipped replies
 are automatically marked as "seen".

2 BACK_TOPIC

  Keypad 5

 BACK TOPIC displays the previous topic in the conference.

 When viewing a directory, KP5 moves the pointer backward.

2 BACK_REPLY

  Keypad 1

 BACK REPLY displays the previous reply in the current discussion. You
 cannot use BACK REPLY if you are reading a topic.

 When viewing  a  directory of entries in your Notebook, KP1 moves the
 pointer  backward to the previous entry with a non-zero Unseen count.

2 NEXT_TOPIC

  Keypad 2

 NEXT TOPIC displays the next topic in the conference.

 When viewing a directory, KP2 moves the pointer forward.

2 NEXT_REPLY

  Keypad 3

 NEXT REPLY displays the next reply in the current discussion.

 When viewing  a  directory of entries in your Notebook, KP3 moves the
 pointer  forward  to the next entry with a non-zero Unseen count. You
 cannot use NEXT REPLY if you are reading the last reply.

1 MARK (m)

 Marks the current or specified note in the current entry.

 Format:

	Note id:
	Marker:

2 Parameters
Marker:		marker-name

 Specifies the name of the marker.

Note id:	note-id

 Specifies a  single topic or reply. The default is the topic or reply
 you are currently reading.

2 Command_Description

 A marker  is  a  word  or phrase that you associate with a particular
 note  so that you can refer to the note by the word or phrase instead
 of  its  note  number.  Marker  names must be unique within an entry,
 although you can use the same marker name in different entries.

 If you  do  not  specify  a  note  to be marked, Emacs Notes adds the
 marker to the note you are currently reading.

 You can  see  all  the markers you created for the current entry, and
 the  note number associated with each, by using either the LIST ENTRY
 command  or  the  "lm",  LIST MARKER, command. To see the note number
 associated  with  a  particular  marker,  use  the "/lm", LIST MARKER
 command.

 To retrieve  a note that you marked, use the READ command and specify
 the name of the marker at the note-id prompt.

 To delete  a  marker,  use  the  "Dm",  DELETE MARKER, command. (This
 deletes the marker only, not the note.)

 The "Am",  ADD  MARKER, and "m", MARK, commands are synonyms, and can
 be used interchangeably.

2 Examples
     Notes> MARK TELEVISION

   Marks the current note with the marker TELEVISION.

     Notes> MARK HYPERSPACE 3.7

   Marks note 3.7 with the marker HYPERSPACE.

Write-lock:	n

 Specifies whether  to  prevent  anyone  other  than  a moderator from
 adding  notes.  The  default  is  WRITE.  You can set this conference
 attribute  at  any  time; for a conference in progress, this prevents
 the  addition  of any new notes. Any note in progress at the time you
 successfully  complete  the "MODIFY CONFERENCE WRITE-LOCK: y" command
 will  not  be  added  to  the  conference.  The author will receive a

 entry  in  your  Notebook.  You must specify the name of the Notebook
 entry you want to modify.

 You can change the name of the conference with the NAME qualifier, or
 change the notefile specification with the FILE qualifier. The change
 is  reflected  in  all classes (if the entry belongs to more than one
 class), and seen/unseen information is unaffected.

 You can change the classes to which an entry belongs with the CLASSES
 qualifier.  The  list  of  classes  you  specify replaces the list of
 classes to which the entry currently belongs. Therefore, to delete an
 entry  from  a  class,  use the CLASSES qualifier and omit that class
 from the new list.

 attributes for the current or specified note:

  o  Puts the note on a "shopping list".

  o  Hides the note from all users except yourself and the author.

  o  Prevents anyone from replying to the note.

 By putting  a  note  on  a shopping list, you give interested users a
 convenient  way  to  add  a new conference to their Notebooks without
 leaving  the  current conference. You use the CONFERENCE qualifier to
 link  the  file specification of the new conference with a particular
 note.  (Emacs  Notes  puts an asterisk (*) next to the note number to
 indicate  that  the  note  is  linked to a conference.) Then, someone
 reading  that note can add the linked conference to their Notebook by
 pressing the SELECT key.

 You can  temporarily hide a note using the HIDDEN qualifier. The note
 remains  part  of  the  conference,  but can be displayed by only the
 author  or  moderator.  All other users get a message indicating this
 note is hidden when they try to access a hidden note.

 Use the NOWRITE qualifier to prevent further replies to a discussion.
 When you want to resume replies, issue the MODIFY NOTE/WRITE command.
 Only  the  moderator  or  the author of the topic can specify whether
 users can enter replies.

 A moderator  can  use  the  TITLE qualifier to change the title of an
 existing note.

 To mark  notes  you  have  not  yet  read as "seen", use the SET SEEN
 command.

3 Examples

	Automatic Directory:
	Automatic Next unseen:
	Default class name:
	Print options:

3 Parameters

Automatic Directory:	y or n
Automatic Unseen:	y or n

 Specifies whether an automatic DIRECTORY or NEXT UNSEEN command is
 issued, or whether you see a conference heading only, when you open
 an entry.

 You can  cancel  the  automatic feature by issuing the MODIFY PROFILE
 command and setting both fields to "n", no. In this case, you see the
 conference heading only when you open an entry.

Default class name:	class-name

 Names the  class  you  want  to  be  the current class when you first
 access your Notebook. Emacs Notes automatically creates a class named
 MAIN  when  you  invoke Emacs Notes for the first time, and specifies
 this  class  as  the  default class in your profile unless you change
 this setting. The class you specify must be an existing class in your
 Notebook.  You  cannot  use  the  wildcard character (*) in the class
 name.


Personal name:		string

 Sets the  personal name string. The personal name string can be up to
 63 characters long. The personal name appears alongside your node and
 user name in the heading of topics or replies you enter.

 To delete a personal name, use PERSONAL_NAME="".

Print options:	qualifier list"

 Sets the  default qualifiers for the Emacs Notes PRINT command. These
 qualifiers are added to the PRINT command before any other qualifiers
 or  parameters  in the PRINT command line. In case of a conflict, the
 qualifiers  on  the  command  line  override  the  default  qualifier
 setting.

 The selection  qualifiers for the PRINT command in Emacs Notes are as
 follows:

  o  /AUTHOR=username
  o  /BEFORE=date-time
  o  /COPIES=number
  o  /FORM=form-name
  o  /KEYWORD=keyword-name
  o  /[NO]NOTIFY
  o  /QUEUE=queue-name
  o  /SEEN
  o  /SINCE=date-time
  o  /TITLE="string"
  o  /UNSEEN

3 Command_Description

 The "Mp",  MODIFY  PROFILE,  command  lets  you  change  the  default
 settings  in  your  profile.  Your  profile  tailors your Emacs Notes
 sessions by specifying:

  o  Whether a directory listing, the first unseen message, or a
     conference heading is automatically displayed when you open a
     conference.

  o  The name of the class you want to be the current class when you
     first access your Notebook (the default class).

  o  A personal name to appear alongside your user name in notes you
     write.

  o  A list of the qualifiers you automatically want to use whenever
     you issue the PRINT command in Emacs Notes.

 Unless you issue the MODIFY PROFILE command to change the default
 settings, your Emacs Notes sessions have the following characteristics:

  o  When you open an entry, the first note you have not seen is
     displayed.

  o  When you issue the PRINT command without any qualifiers, the
     following happens:

      -  The notes you specified are not printed until you end your
         Emacs Notes session (or change the print queue).

      -  The notes are printed on the default printer at your
         installation (queue SYS$PRINT).

      -  You are not notified when the print job is complete.

      -  You get one copy of each note.

  o  When you write or reply to a note, your node and user name appear
     in the note heading, and the area reserved for your personal name
     is blank.

  o  The class called MAIN is the default class.

 You can  temporarily  change  the  settings  in  your profile for the
 current Emacs Notes session using the TEMPORARY qualifier. Otherwise,
 any  time  you  use the MODIFY PROFILE command to alter your profile,
 the settings are permanently changed.

 If you set up a list of default qualifiers for the PRINT command, any
 additional  qualifiers you use in the PRINT command line are appended
 to  the default qualifiers. If you include a qualifier with the PRINT
 command  that  conflicts with the default qualifiers in your profile,
 the qualifier on the command line takes precedence.

3 Examples
     Notes> MODIFY PROFILE /PRINT="/QUEUE=LPB0/NOWAIT"

   When you issue the PRINT command, the notes are printed
   immediately on the printer specified by the queue-name LPB0.

     Notes> MODIFY PROFILE /PRINT="/COPIES=2"
     Notes> PRINT/NOTIFY/QUEUE=LQP 3.*

   Emacs Notes treats the PRINT command line as if you had typed
   PRINT/COPIES=2/NOTIFY/QUEUE=LQP 3.*.  You get two copies of base
   note 3 and all its replies.  The system prints the notes on the
   letter quality printer (LQP) and notifies you when printing is
   complete.

     Notes> MODIFY PROFILE /PERSONAL_NAME="Johnny Be Good"

   Displays the phrase 'Johnny Be Good' next to your node and user
   name in the heading of topics or replies you enter.

     Notes> MODIFY PROFILE /EDITOR=EDT

   Sets up EVE with the EDT-style keypad as the editor for Emacs Notes
   and specifies that Emacs Notes is to access EVE by calling it
   directly.

     Notes> MODIFY PROFILE /EDITOR=(EDT,CALL)

   Sets up EDT as the editor for Emacs Notes and specifies that VAX
   Notes is to access EDT by calling it directly.

     Notes> MODIFY PROFILE /EDITOR=("@MYDIR:EDITOR",SPAWN)

   Sets up the editor invoked by the command procedure EDITOR in the
   directory MYDIR: as the editor to use in Emacs Notes.

     Notes> MODIFY PROFILE /CLASS=PRIVATE

   Sets PRIVATE as the default class.  When you first access your
   Notebook, PRIVATE is the current class.

     Notes> MODIFY PROFILE /AUTOMATIC=UNSEEN

   When you open an entry, Emacs Notes automatically issues the NEXT
   UNSEEN command to display the first note you have not yet seen.
   You can use keypad comma to continue to read unseen notes.

2 Command_Description

 The PRINT  command  prints  the  current  note  or,  optionally,  the
 specified  range of notes. You can use several qualifiers in a single
 PRINT command line with these exceptions or conditions:

  o  To use BEFORE and SINCE to specify a time interval, make sure
     that the date-time you specify for SINCE is earlier than the
     date-time you specify for BEFORE.

  o  The keyword you specify with KEYWORD must be an existing
     keyword for the conference.

  o  The following qualifiers should only be used when you specify a
     range of notes:

        AUTHOR          SINCE
        BEFORE          TITLE
        KEYWORD         UNSEEN
        SEEN

 You can  set up a list of default qualifiers for the PRINT command in
 your  profile.  These qualifiers are executed by default whenever you
 use  the  PRINT  command; you do not have to type the qualifiers each
 time.  You  can  override the default qualifiers on the command line.
 See  the  "Sp", SET PROFILE, command for information about setting up
 default qualifiers for the PRINT command.

1 READ (r)

Displays the specified note.

    Format:
	Read note (nn.rr)

2 Parameters
Read note (nn.rr)	note-ID

 Specifies a single topic, reply or marker to be displayed.

2 Command_Description

 The "r", READ, command displays the topic or reply you specify.

 To display  a  note  you marked, use the READ command, specifying the
 marker name instead of the note number.

 The READ  command will default the note to be read whenever possible.
 If  you have just used the "dn", DIRECTORY of NOTES, command move the
 cursor  to the directory entry for the note you wish to read and type
 "r".  If  you  have  used  the  "\lk", LIST KEYWORDS command move the
 cursor  to  note  id that you wish to read and type "r". Use the "v",
 VIEW,  command to return to the directory listing or keyword listing.

 You can  see  the  number  of  the  note associated with a particular
 marker by issuing the "lm", LIST MARKER, command.

 You can  use  the  "nn",  NEXT NOTE, command to page through notes in
 succession.

 To skip the rest of the current discussion, and display the next note
 you have not yet seen, issue the "u", NEXT UNSEEN, command.

2 Examples

 string, issue the "s", SEARCH, command again.

 You will be able to search for the next occurrence of the same string
 at  any time until you specify another string with the SEARCH command
 or close the conference.

                                     NOTE

      Be aware that searching through the entire conference can take
      a long time to finish.

1 SELECT

  Selects an item from a list displayed on your screen.  Also selects
  a conference from a "shopping list" and adds the conference to your
  Notebook.

2 Command_Description
 The SELECT command lets you select an item from a list displayed
 on your screen without having to specify the item on the command
 line.  When you issue the DIRECTORY/ENTRIES command (to see a list
 of available entries) or the DIRECTORY command (to list notes in
 a conference), Emacs Notes displays a pointer (>) at the far left of
 the screen.  Move this pointer forward (using KP2) or backward
 (using KP5) through the list until the pointer is at the item you
 want.  Then, issue the SELECT command (or press KP7) to select the
 item.

 When you are viewing a list of entries, keypad key KP3 skips forward
 to the next entry with a non-zero unseen count, and keypad key KP1
 skips backward to the previous entry with a non-zero unseen count.
 When you press the SELECT key, Emacs Notes opens the entry you selected.

 When you are viewing a directory of notes, Emacs Notes displays the
 note you selected.

 You can also use the SELECT command to select a conference from a
 "shopping list" and add the conference to your Notebook.  To select a
 conference that is on a shopping list, read a note that has an asterisk
 (*) next to the note number in the heading and issue the SELECT command.
 The conference is added to your Notebook; the conference name is
 used as the entry name.  You can issue the SET CLASS command before using
 the SELECT command to add the conference to a particular existing class.

 To see the name of the conference linked to a note that has an asterisk
 next to its note number, use the LIST NOTE command.

 You can also use the SELECT key on the editing keypad (VT200-series
 terminals) or KP7 to issue this command.

1 SEND
Sends a mail message to one or more users without leaving Emacs Notes.

 Not implemented yet.

   Format:

     SEND [file-spec]

The square brackets [] indicate that the enclosed item is optional.
2 Parameters
file-spec

 Specifies a file to send as the mail message.
2 Command_Description
 The SEND command sends a mail message to one or more users by the
 VAX/VMS Mail Utility (MAIL) without leaving Emacs Notes.  You list the
 addressees at the Send to:  prompt.

 You can send the same message to all members in the conference
 (without specifying these users individually) by using the /MEMBERS
 qualifier.  Using the /MEMBERS qualifier suppresses the Send to:
 prompt.

 To send a file as the mail message, include the file specification in
 the SEND command line.  You can use the /NOEDIT qualifier to send the
 file without editing it.  If you do not specify a file to send as
 your mail message, you cannot use the /NOEDIT qualifier.
2 Qualifiers
/AUTHOR

 Specifies that you wish to send the message to the author of
 the note you are currently reading.  Notice that the Send to:
 prompt does not appear when you use the /AUTHOR qualifier.

/EDIT (default)
/NOEDIT

 Specifies whether or not to invoke the editor to send the message.

/LAST

 Specifies that you wish to start off in the editor with the
 last message that you mailed using the SEND or FORWARD command.

/MEMBERS

 Sends the mail message to all members on the membership list for
 the conference.  You can use this qualifier only when a membership
 list exists.
2 Examples
     Notes> SEND /NOEDIT MESSAGE.TEXT
     Send to: BIGSIS::EDISON,LILSIS::MARSH
     Subject: Progress Report on Project Clean-Up.
     Notes>

   Sends the text file named MESSAGE.TEXT, without editing, to users
   BIGSIS::EDISON and LILSIS::MARSH, with the subject 'Progress Report
   on Project Clean-Up'.  After the message is sent, you return to VAX
   Notes.

     Notes> SEND /MEMBERS
     Subject: Announcing a New Conference on Networking Technology

   Puts you in EVE (or your chosen editor) to let you type a mail
   message to send to all members in the conference.  Notice that the
   Send to:  prompt does not appear when you use the /MEMBERS
   qualifier.

     Notes> SEND /AUTHOR
     Subject: Let's discuss your ideas at tomorrow's meeting

   Puts you in EVE (or your chosen editor) to let you type a message to
   send to the author of the note you are currently reading.  The node and
   username appearing in the note header are used as the mailing address.

1 SET (S)

 Sets various  attributes for notes, conferences, privileged users, or
 profiles.

2 CLASS (Sc)

 Allows you to make a specified class the current class.

    Format:
	Set-class 

3 Parameters
Set-class	class-name

 Specifies the name of the class you want to be the current class.

3 Command_Description

 The "Sc", SET CLASS, command allows you to make a specified class the
 current  class.  Once you specify a class with the SET CLASS command,
 Emacs  Notes  assumes this class when performing commands (unless you
 specify another class with the CLASS field in an individual command).
 The  SET CLASS command is similar to the SELECT FOLDER command in the
 VAX/VMS Mail Utility (MAIL).

 Use the  SET  CLASS command when you want to permanently override the
 default  class  specified in your profile for the current Emacs Notes
 session.  The  class  you  specify with SET CLASS remains the current
 class  until  you  issue  the  SET  CLASS command again or exit Emacs
 Notes.

 The class  you specify with the SET CLASS command must be an existing
 class  in your Notebook. You cannot use the wildcard character (*) in
 the class name.

3 Examples

2 CONFERENCE (SC)

 Sets information for an existing conference.

   Format:

	Title:
	Notice:
	Restrict members:
	Restrict keywords:
	Write-lock:

3 Command_Description

 Use the "SC", SET CONFERENCE, command to set or change the following
 information for an existing conference:

  o  The title, which appears in the conference heading

  o  The notice, which appears beneath the conference title in the
     heading

  o  Whether to restrict access, keyword creation, or both to specific
     members

  o  Whether anyone besides you can enter notes in the conference

 You must be a moderator for the conference, and must have enabled
 your moderator privileges with the SET MODERATOR command, before
 using the SET CONFERENCE command.

 When you restrict access, keyword creation, or both, you must specify
 the users who can access the conference (called members), and which
 of these users can create keywords.  You use the ADD MEMBER command
 to specify members and assign privileges to them.

 To set  up  a  bulletin board, in which only you can write notes, set
 WRITE to "n", no write.

3 Parameters
Title:		string

 Modifies or  sets  the  title  of  the  conference  to the string you
 specify. Surround the string with quotation marks.

Notice:		string

 Modifies or  sets  the  notice  for  the conference to the string you
 specify. To remove the notice leave the field blank.

Write-lock:	n

 Specifies whether  to  prevent  anyone  other  than  a moderator from
 adding  notes.  The  default  is  WRITE.  You can set this conference
 attribute  at  any  time; for a conference in progress, this prevents
 the  addition  of any new notes. Any note in progress at the time you
 successfully  complete  the "MODIFY CONFERENCE WRITE-LOCK: y" command
 will  not  be  added  to  the  conference.  The author will receive a
 message indicating that the conference is write-protected.

Restrict Members:
Restrict Keywords:

 Specifies whether or not to restrict access to the conference,
 keyword creation, or both.

3 Examples

Title:		Course Evaluation System
Notice:

   keywords, and sets the title of the conference to 'Course
   Evaluation System'.

     Notes> SET CONF /RESTRICT=(KEYWORDS) /NOTICE="NASA Project"

   Allows anyone to access the conference but restricts the creation
   of keywords to users with CREATE_KEYWORDS privilege (see the ADD
   MEMBER command).  In addition, this command sets the notice to
   'NASA Project'.

Title:		title
Notice:		notice
Restrict:	n
Write-lock:	y

   Prevents anyone besides yourself from entering new notes from this
   point on.

2 ENTRY (Se)

Personal name: string

 Sets the personal-name associated with this entry to string.

3 Command_Description

 The "Se",  SET  ENTRY, command lets you set or modify information for
 an  entry in your Notebook. You must specify the name of the Notebook
 entry you want to modify.

 You can  change the name of the conference with the "New entry name:"
 field, or change the notefile specification with the "Notefile name:"
 field.  The  change is reflected in all classes (if the entry belongs
 to more than one class), and seen/unseen information is unaffected.

 You can  change  the  classes  to  which  an  entry  belongs with the
 "Classes:"  field.  The list of classes you specify replaces the list
 of classes to which the entry currently belongs. Therefore, to delete
 an  entry  from a class, use the "Classes:" field and omit that class
 from the new list.

3 Examples
Entry name:		CLIMATE
New entry name:		WEATHER
Notefile name:		file-name
Classes:		MAIN
Personal name:		

   Changes the name of the entry CLIMATE to WEATHER.

   BROWN.  This listing replaces the previous listing.

     Notes> SET MEMBER BYRD /PRIV=MODERATE

   Grants MODERATE privilege to member BYRD, and automatically grants
   this member CREATE_KEYWORDS privilege.

2 MODERATOR (SM)

Enables or disable moderator privileges.

3 Command_Description

 You must  issue  the  SET  MODERATOR  command  to  perform  Moderator
 commands  (provided  you  are the owner of the conference, or another
 moderator  has  authorized  you to act as moderator). As long as your
 member  record  for  this  conference  indicates  you  have  MODERATE
 privilege,  you  can  issue  the  SET  MODERATOR command. 

 Each time  you use the SET MODERATOR command your moderator status is
 changed. If you where a moderator, moderator privilege is disable. If
 you were disable then you will be enabled.

 Emacs notes displays the word "Moderator" in the conference header so
 that you can alway tell if you been enable as a moderator.

 You can see whether you have MODERATE privilege in two ways:

  o  Use the LIST MEMBER command to see your member record.

  o  Use the LIST MODERATOR command to see if your user name is listed
     as a moderator for this conference.

 You can temporarily suspend your moderator privilege by issuing the
 SET MODERATOR command.  When you do this, you forfeit the ability
 to delete or hide other users' notes, to add new users or change
 existing users' privileges, and so on.  You can suspend and reinstate
 moderator privilege at any time, and as often as you like.  Your
 member record does not change when you issue the SET NOMODERATOR
 command.

3 Examples
     Notes> SET MODERATOR

   Allows you to perform Moderator commands.

     Notes> SET NOMODERATOR

   Suspends your moderator privilege.  Emacs Notes recognizes you as an
   ordinary user until you issue the SET MODERATOR command.

2 NOTE
Sets attributes for the specified note.

   Format:
	Set note (note-id)

	Title:
	Hidden:
	Write-lock:
	Seen:

3 Parameters
Set note (note-id)	note-ID

 Specifies a  single  topic  or reply. The default is the note you are
 currently reading.

File-name:	notefile-spec

 Associates the  specified conference with this note to allow users to
 add  the  conference  to  their Notebooks by pressing the SELECT key.
 Notes  that  are  linked to conferences by the MODIFY NOTE/CONFERENCE
 command have an asterisk (*) next to the note number.

Hidden:		y or n

 Specifies whether  users can display this note. Hidden notes can only
 be  viewed  by  the  author  or  the moderator. All other users get a
 message indicating that the note is hidden.

Title:		string

 Allows a moderator to change the title of an existing note.

Write-lock:	y or n

 Specifies whether users can enter further replies to this topic. Only
 the moderator or the author of the topic can specify this.

Seen:		y

 Set the note as seen.

3 Command_Description

 The "Sn",  SET  NOTE,  command  sets the following attributes for the
 current or specified note:

  o  Puts the note on a "shopping list".

  o  Hides the note from all users except yourself and the author.

  o  Prevents anyone from replying to the note.

 By putting  a  note  on  a shopping list, you give interested users a
 convenient  way  to  add  a new conference to their Notebooks without
 leaving  the  current  conference.  You  use  the SET NOTE/CONFERENCE
 command  to  link the file specification of the new conference with a
 particular  note.  (Emacs Notes puts an asterisk (*) next to the note
 number  to  indicate  that the note is linked to a conference.) Then,
 someone  reading  that  note  can  add the linked conference to their
 Notebook by pressing the SELECT key.

 You can temporarily hide a note using the /HIDDEN qualifier.  The
 note remains part of the conference, but can be displayed by only the
 author or moderator.  All other users get a message indicating this
 note is hidden when they try to access a hidden note.

 Use the /NOWRITE qualifier to prevent further replies to a
 discussion.  When you want to resume replies, issue the SET
 NOTE/WRITE command.  Only the moderator or the author of the topic
 can specify whether users can enter replies.

 A moderator can use the /TITLE qualifier to change the title of an
 existing note.

 To mark notes you have not yet read as "seen", use the SET SEEN
 command.

3 Examples
      Notes> SET NOTE /CONFERENCE=ANGEL::METHODS

   Associates the conference METHODS on node ANGEL with the note you
   are currently reading.  Users reading this note can add the
   conference METHODS to their Notebooks by pressing the SELECT key.

     Notes> SET NOTE /HIDDEN 3.4

   Only the author of topic 3 or the conference moderator can read
   note 3.4.

     Notes> SET NOTE /NOWRITE /NOHIDDEN 55.7

   Permits users to read the previously hidden note 55.7, but prevents
   users from making further replies to topic 55.

2 PROFILE

 Sets information in your profile.

   Format:
	Personal name:
	Automatic Directory:
	Automatic Next unseen:
	Default class name:
	Print options:

3 Parameters

Automatic Directory:	y or n
Automatic Unseen:	y or n

 Specifies whether an automatic DIRECTORY or NEXT UNSEEN command is
 issued, or whether you see a conference heading only, when you open
 an entry.

 You can  cancel  the  automatic feature by issuing the MODIFY PROFILE
 command and setting both fields to "n", no. In this case, you see the
 conference heading only when you open an entry.

Default class name:	class-name

 Names the  class  you  want  to  be  the current class when you first
 access your Notebook. Emacs Notes automatically creates a class named
 MAIN  when  you  invoke Emacs Notes for the first time, and specifies
 this  class  as  the  default class in your profile unless you change
 this setting. The class you specify must be an existing class in your
 Notebook.  You  cannot  use  the  wildcard character (*) in the class
 name.


Personal name:		string

 Sets the  personal name string. The personal name string can be up to
 63 characters long. The personal name appears alongside your node and
 user name in the heading of topics or replies you enter.

 To delete a personal name, use PERSONAL_NAME="".

Print options:	qualifier list"

 Sets the  default qualifiers for the Emacs Notes PRINT command. These
 qualifiers are added to the PRINT command before any other qualifiers
 or  parameters  in the PRINT command line. In case of a conflict, the
 qualifiers  on  the  command  line  override  the  default  qualifier
 setting.

 The selection  qualifiers for the PRINT command in Emacs Notes are as
 follows:

  o  /AUTHOR=username
  o  /BEFORE=date-time
  o  /COPIES=number
  o  /FORM=form-name
  o  /KEYWORD=keyword-name
  o  /[NO]NOTIFY
  o  /QUEUE=queue-name
  o  /SEEN
  o  /SINCE=date-time
  o  /TITLE="string"
  o  /UNSEEN

3 Command_Description

 The "Sp",  SET  PROFILE, command lets you change the default settings
 in  your  profile.  Your profile tailors your Emacs Notes sessions by
 specifying:

  o  The editor of your choice, and the method for accessing the
     editor.

  o  Whether a directory listing, the first unseen message, or a
     conference heading is automatically displayed when you open a
     conference.

  o  The name of the class you want to be the current class when you
     first access your Notebook (the default class).

  o  A personal name to appear alongside your user name in notes you
     write.

  o  A list of the qualifiers you automatically want to use whenever
     you issue the PRINT command in Emacs Notes.

 Unless you  issue  the  SET  PROFILE  command  to  change the default
 settings,    your   Emacs   Notes   sessions   have   the   following
 characteristics:

  o  When you open an entry, the first note you have not seen is
     displayed.

  o  When you issue the PRINT command without any qualifiers, the
     following happens:

      -  The notes you specified are not printed until you end your
         Emacs Notes session (or change the print queue).

      -  The notes are printed on the default printer at your
         installation (queue SYS$PRINT).

      -  You are not notified when the print job is complete.

      -  You get one copy of each note.

  o  When you write or reply to a note, your node and user name appear
     in the note heading, and the area reserved for your personal name
     is blank.

  o  The class called MAIN is the default class.

 If you set up a list of default qualifiers for the PRINT command, any
 additional qualifiers you use in the PRINT command line are appended
 to the default qualifiers.  If you include a qualifier with the PRINT
 command that conflicts with the default qualifiers in your profile,
 the qualifier on the command line takes precedence.

3 Examples
     Notes> SET PROFILE /PRINT="/QUEUE=LPB0/NOWAIT"

   When you issue the PRINT command, the notes are printed
   immediately on the printer specified by the queue-name LPB0.

     Notes> SET PROFILE /PRINT="/COPIES=2"
     Notes> PRINT/NOTIFY/QUEUE=LQP 3.*

   Emacs Notes treats the PRINT command line as if you had typed
   PRINT/COPIES=2/NOTIFY/QUEUE=LQP 3.*.  You get two copies of base
   note 3 and all its replies.  The system prints the notes on the
   letter quality printer (LQP) and notifies you when printing is
   complete.

     Notes> SET PROFILE /PERSONAL_NAME="Johnny Be Good"

   Displays the phrase 'Johnny Be Good' next to your node and user
   name in the heading of topics or replies you enter.

     Notes> SET PROFILE /EDITOR=EDT

   and specifies that Emacs Notes is to access EVE by calling it
   directly.

     Notes> SET PROFILE /EDITOR=(EDT,CALL)

   Notes is to access EDT by calling it directly.

     Notes> SET PROFILE /EDITOR=("@MYDIR:EDITOR",SPAWN)

   Sets PRIVATE as the default class.  When you first access your
   Notebook, PRIVATE is the current class.

     Notes> SET PROFILE /AUTOMATIC=UNSEEN

   When you open an entry, Emacs Notes automatically issues the NEXT
   UNSEEN command to display the first note you have not yet seen.
   You can use keypad comma to continue to read unseen notes.

2 SEEN (SS, Ss)

   Format:

 positioned  anywhere  in  the  conference  when  you  issue the WRITE
 command.


 Emacs Notes immediately prompts you for a title for the topic.

 If Emacs Notes is unable to write your topic, or if you cancel your
 entry,  you  can  retrieve  the  text  of  your  last  note  from the
 notefile-new-note-'n'  buffer. 'n' is the number of the notes seesion
 that you are using, normally session 1.

 If you want to start a new conference, use the CREATE CONFERENCE
 command.

2 Examples
     Notes> WRITE

   Invokes the editor with an empty NOTES$EDIT buffer, and assigns
   your note the next available topic number.

     Notes> WRITE /NOEDIT COURSES.TXT

   Gets the text for the topic from the file COURSES.TXT without
   invoking the editor.

     Notes> WRITE /LAST

   Invokes the editor and retrieves the most recent contents of the
   NOTES$EDIT buffer.

     Notes> CLOSE BOOKS
     Notes> OPEN RESTAURANTS
     Notes> WRITE /LAST

   Uses the text last stored in the NOTES$EDIT buffer as the text for
   the next topic in the RESTAURANTS conference.  This allows you to
   enter the same note in more than one conference without having to
   retype it each time.  Because WRITE/LAST invokes the editor, you
   can edit the text before you enter it in the new conference, if
   desired.

 Before you can read the notes in a conference, you must first add the
 conference to your Notebook, then open the conference.


| To see  a  listing  of  the  conferences  that  are available on your
| system, type:
|
|	Notes> DIRECTORY/CONFERENCES
|
| The name  of  each  conference  appears in capital letters. The title

 A conference  is  organized  into discussions. Each discussion begins
 with  a TOPIC, each having any number of REPLIES. Topics are numbered
 consecutively,   starting   with   1.   Replies   are  also  numbered
 consecutively,  by topic, starting with .1. For example, if there are
 three replies to topic 4, they are numbered 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.

 To see a listing of the topics in a conference, type:

		"dn"

 Use the RETURN key to see more of the directory listing.

 To read a specific topic or reply, Use the "r", READ command and type

                                     NOTE

          A command format that shows a range of notes as a parameter
          also allows a single note-ID as a parameter, but the reverse
          is not true.  A command format that shows a single note as a
          parameter does NOT accept a range of notes.

1 Terms_and_Concepts

Emacs Notes is a computer-mediated conferencing system.  It allows many
people to communicate at their convenience, usually on a single
subject or issue. In Emacs Notes, a private meeting to discuss marketing
strategy, an electronic bulletin board to announce course offerings,
or a public forum on environmental issues are all examples of
CONFERENCES.

A conference is organized into any number of TOPICS, each of which can
have any number of REPLIES.  A topic and its associated replies are
called a DISCUSSION.  Topics are identified as n.0, where n is a
number assigned sequentially by the system.  Replies to a topic note
are also sequentially numbered, starting with .1.  If topic 4 has 3
replies, the replies are numbered 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.  Topics and
replies are referred to collectively as NOTES.

The first time you invoke Emacs Notes, a NOTEBOOK is automatically
created for you.  In your Notebook, you store the names of conferences
you are interested in.  This figure shows how a typical Notebook might
be organized, and how notes are arranged in a conference:

A CLASS is a group of conferences that is related in some way.  A class works
work like a tabbed divider to keep related conferences together.
You can also think of a class as something like a mail folder in MAIL, or
a VAX/VMS subdirectory.  Unlike a mail folder, however, a conference can
be in more than one class at a time.  You can create as many classes
as you want in your Notebook.
