<p>The Barry's Emacs <a href="mlisp_programmers_guide.html">Programmer's Guide</a> describes how to extend Emacs using the Mock Lisp programming language.</p>

<p>The Barry's Emacs <a href="mlisp_programmers_guide.html">Mock Lisp Reference</a> Manual contains an alphabetically ordered list of all Emacs functions and variables available in the Mock Lisp programming language.</p>

<p>The Barry's Emacs <a href="extensions_guide.html">Extensions Reference</a> Manual documents the Emacs extensions (packages, subsystems and libraries) that are distributed with Barry's Emacs.</p>

<h2><a name="conventions">Conventions</a></h2>

<p>Throughout this text, key sequences are described as causing specific actions to occur (functions to run, for example). These key sequences are those set up when Emacs is started (they are the default key bindings).</p>

<p>Key sequences are displayed with each key separated by a dash. When using these sequences, do not include the dashes. The dashes are displayed for clarity only.</p>

<p>Many Emacs key sequences use <span class="key">Control</span> keys. These are indicated by a caret character (^) appearing in the key sequence. For example, to type the <span class="key">^O</span> key sequence, press and hold down the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key and simlutaneously press the <span class="key">O</span> key. The special sequence <span class="key">^^</span> is used in some Emacs key sequences. To type <span class="key">^^</span>, press and hold down the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key, then simultaneously type the <span class="key">^</span> key.</p>

<p>Many other Emacs key sequences use <span class="key">Escape</span> keys. These are indicated with an <span class="key">ESC-</span> in the key sequence. For example, to type the <span class="key">ESC-e</span> key sequence, press the key labelled <span class="key">ESC</span>, then press the <span class="key">e</span> key. Note that <span class="key">ESC-</span> key sequences are case-sensitive; this means that <span class="key">ESC-e</span> is not the same as <span class="key">ESC-E</span>.</p>

<p>Different typefaces used in this book are used to distinguish between normal text and special symbols. These are described as follows:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><span class="key">Return</span></td>
<td>The following special characters are displayed as shown:
<span class="key">Return</span>, <span class="key">Delete</span>, 
<span class="key">Escape</span>, <span class="key">Tab</span>, 
<span class="key">Backspace</span>, <span class="key">Linefeed</span> 
and <span class="key">Space</span>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><pre>This is an example</pre></td>
<td>All examples and system displays are shown like this.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="cmd">execute-mlisp-file</span></td>
<td>All keystroke sequences, function names, command names and variable names are displayed in this typeface.</td>
</tr>
</table>
