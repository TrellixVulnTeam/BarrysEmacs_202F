<h1><a name="P20_388"></a>Barry's Emacs Programmer's Guide</h1>

<p>This Guide describes how to program the Barry's Emacs editor.
It contains a definition for the Mock Lisp programming language and describes,
in detail, all the primitive Mock Lisp functions and system variables.</p>

<h2>conventions used in this document</h2>

<p>Throughout this manual, key sequences are described as causing specific actions to occur (functions to run, for example). These key sequences are those set up when Emacs is started (they are the default key bindings).</p>

<p>Key sequences are displayed with each key separated by a dash. When using these sequences, do not include the dashes. The dashes are displayed for clarity only.</p>

<p>Many Emacs key sequences use <span class="key">Control</span> keys. These are indicated by a caret character (^) appearing in the key sequence. For example, to type the <span class="key">^O</span> key sequence, press and hold down the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key and simultaneously press the <span class="key">O</span> key. To type <span class="key">^^</span>, press and hold down the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key, then simultaneously type the <span class="key">^</span> key.</p>

<p>Many other Emacs key sequences use <span class="key">Escape</span> keys. These are indicated with an <span class="key">ESC-</span> in the key sequence. For example, to type the <span class="key">ESC-e</span> key sequence, press the key labelled <span class="key">ESC</span>, then press the <span class="key">e</span> key. Note that <span class="key">ESC-</span> key sequences are case-sensitive; this means that <span class="key">ESC-e</span> is not the same as <span class="key">ESC-E</span>.</p>

<p>Different typefaces used in this book are used to distinguish between normal text and special symbols. These are described in the following table:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><span class="key">Return</span></td>
<td>The following special characters are displayed as shown:
<span class="key">Return</span>, <span class="key">Delete</span>, 
<span class="key">Escape</span>, <span class="key">Tab</span>, 
<span class="key">Backspace</span>, <span class="key">Linefeed</span> 
and <span class="key">Space</span>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><pre>This is an example</pre></td>
<td>All examples and system displays are shown like this.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="cmd">execute-mlisp-file</span></td>
<td>All keystroke sequences, function names, command names and variable names are displayed in this typeface.</td>
</tr>
