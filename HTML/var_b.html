<blockquote>
<p>The value of this variable controls the way that Emacs creates backup files.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th align="left" width="100">Value</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>"none"</td>
<td>Do not create backup files</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>"copy"</td>
<td>Create backup file by copying</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>"rename"</td>
<td>Create backup file by renaming</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Use backup by "copy" on Unix systems to leave the file protection and symbolic links unchanged.</p>

<p>Use backup by "rename" to speed up file saving.</p>

<p>Use backup "none" to prevent backup files being created.</p>

<p><a name="backup-filename-format"></a><span class="cmd">backup-filename-format</span> &#171; "%pa%fn._%1ft"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This variable controls how emacs names backup files. 
Emacs bases the backup filename on the buffers file name as directed by the format string.</p>

<p>The syntax of the format string is the same as used by the command file-format-string.
The equivilent MLisp would be:</p>

<pre>
    (setq backup-filename
        (file-format-string
            backup-filename-format 
            current-buffer-file-name))
</pre>

<p>The default format create backup files in the same director as the original file but with a leading "_" prefixed to the file type. For example <span class="cmd">c:\docs\readme.txt</span> is backed up as <span class="cmd">c:\docs\readme._txt</span>.</p>

<p><a name="black-on-white"></a><span class="cmd">black-on-white</span> &#171; 0</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Records the type of screen on which Emacs is running. If non-zero, text is displayed on the screen as black characters on a white background. If zero, text is displayed as white characters on a black background. This information is used by some terminal interfaces to decide how to display a visible bell.</p>

<p><a name="breakpoint-hook"></a><span class="cmd">breakpoint-hook</span> &#171;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contains the name of the breakpoint function. When a breakpoint occurs, the function whose name is in breakpoint-hook is called.</p>

<p>The breakpoint function may decompile the expression that will be executed by using the decompile-current-line function.</p>

<p><a name="buffer-backup-filename-hook"></a><span class="cmd">buffer-backup-filename-hook</span> &#171; ""</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Emacs calls the function in buffer-backup-filename-hook with the filename being backed up.
The function is expected to return a string containing the filename to backup the file to.
</p>

<pre>
    (defun
        my-backup-filename-maker(~filename)
        ; backup to the filename with a "~" appended

<blockquote>
<p>Emacs calls the function in buffer-choose-name-hook with the filename being loaded into a new buffer.
The function is expected to return a string containing the name to use for the new buffer.
</p>
<pre>
    (defun

<p><a name="buffer-is-modified"></a><span class="cmd">buffer-is-modified</span> &#171; 0</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is positive if the current buffer has been modified since it was last written out to disk. You may set it to 0 if you want Emacs to ignore the modifications that have been made to a buffer. However, this does not restore the unmodified version of the buffer -- it merely tells Emacs not to write out the buffer with other modified files. Emacs sets buffer-is-modified positive any time the buffer is modified.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="buffer-names"></a><span class="cmd">buffer-names</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 1-dimensional array which contains all the buffer names currently in use in Emacs. Element 0 of the array is a count of the total number of buffers contained in the array.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="buffer-saved-as-hook"></a><span class="cmd">buffer-saved-as-hook</span> &#171; 0</p>

<blockquote>
