<!-- ABBREV Abbreviation handling</P>-->
<P>The ABBREV library provides useful functions that allow you to manipulate abbreviations. To access these functions, you must load ABBREV using <KBD>ESC-x execute-mlisp-file</KBD>.</P>

<P>The functions defined in the ABBREV library and their key bindings are as follows:</P>

<HR>
<P><B>^X-G (define-global-abbrev-in-buffer)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Takes the word to the left of dot and defines it as a global abbreviation. You are prompted for the expansion in the Mini-buffer.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><B>^X-L (define-local-abbrev-in-buffer)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Takes the word to the left of dot and defines it as an abbreviation in the current buffer's local abbreviation table. You are prompted for the abbreviation's expansion in the Mini-buffer.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><B>(list-local-abbrevs)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Displays a buffer called Abbrev list and fills it with the abbreviations and their expansions in effect for the current buffer.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><B>^X-W (edit-local-abbrevs)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Displays a buffer called Abbrev list, fills it with the abbreviations and their expansions in effect for the current buffer and then enters a recursive edit so that you can edit these definitions. When the recursive edit is exited, the buffer is used to define the new abbreviations.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><B>(list-all-abbrevs)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Displays a buffer called Abbrev list and fills it with the abbreviations and expansions currently defined in Emacs.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><B>(edit-all-abbrevs)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Displays a buffer called Abbrev list, fills it with all the abbreviations defined in the current Emacs, and then enters a recursive edit to let you alter these abbreviations. When you exit the recursive edit, the modified buffer contents are used to define the abbreviations.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><B>^X-R (define-global-abbrev-for-region)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Uses the region as an expansion and prompts you for an abbreviation. The abbreviation is defined in the global abbreviation table.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><B>^X-S (define-local-abbrev-for-region)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Uses the region as an expansion and prompts you for an abbreviation. The abbreviation is defined in the current buffer's local abbreviation table.</P>

<!--<P><I><B>AREA, Vertically Bounded Cut And Paste </B></I> AREA Rectangular cut and paste</P>-->
<P>The AREA package defines two functions that allow you to define a box and then remove the text from that box leaving the text not included in the box undisturbed. The removed text is stored in a buffer called Area. This text may be inserted later at some other location.</P>

<P>The AREA functions and key bindings are:</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><B>ESC-w (delete-area)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Deletes a vertically-bounded area, storing the deleted area in a buffer named Area.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><B>ESC-y (insert-area)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Inserts the contents of the Area buffer into the current buffer at dot.</P>

<P>The AREA library has been superceded by the RECTANGULAR library, but it is still supplied with Emacs for compatibility with existing MLisp code. For details on the RECTANGULAR library, see <A href="#rectangular">RECTANGULAR, Rectangular Cut and Paste</A></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<H2><A name="buff"></A>BUFF, One Line Buffer Listing</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This library defines the single function one-line-buffer-list. This function displays the names of all of the buffers in Emacs in the mode line. If more that one line's worth of buffers exist, each line of names is displayed and a character input to display the next line. The default binding for the one-line-buffer-list function is <KBD>^X-^B</KBD>.</P>

<P>Some buffers in the list may be preceded by a single character. The various characters and their meanings are:</P>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><STRONG>*</STRONG></TD>
<TD>Indicates that the buffer has been modified since it was last written to disk</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><STRONG>#</STRONG></TD>
<TD>Indicates that the buffer is a scratch buffer.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><STRONG>@</STRONG></TD>
<TD>Indicates that the buffer is empty.</TD>

<H2><A name="centerlin"></A>CENTERLIN, Line Centering</H2>

<!--<P><I><B>CENTERLIN, Line Centering </B></I> CENTERLIN Line centering Centering lines center-line left-margin right-margin</P>-->
<P>The CENTERLIN library package defines the single function center-line which can be used to centre the current line between the margins as defined by left-margin and right-margin.</P>

<P>There is no default binding for the center-line function.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A name="dabbrev"></A>DABBREV, Dynamic Abbreviation Expansion</H2>

<!--<P><I><B>DABBREV, Dynamic Abbreviation Expansion </B></I> DABBREV dabbrev Dynamic abbrevation expansion Abbreviations, dynamic expansion of</P>-->

<P>The DABBREV library defines the dabbrev function. The dabbrev function takes the word that the cursor is positioned in and looks through the buffer for a word for which the current word is a prefix. If a match is found, the current word is expanded into the full word.</P>

<P>For example, if you have already typed the word FOOBAR into the buffer, you can then type the subword FOO, then execute the dabbrev function and FOO will be expanded to FOOBAR.</P>

<hr>
<P><B>dabbrev-expand-whole-word 0</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This variable changes the way dabbrev works when you start dabbrev in the middle of a word.
Either dabbrev uses the whole of the word as the prefix to expand or dabbrev uses the beginning of
the word and deletes the end of the word.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<hr>
<P><B>^W (dabbrev)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>dabbrev.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A name="dent"></A>DENT, Region Indentation</H2>

<!--<P><I><B>DENT, Region Indentation </B></I> DENT Indentation indent-region undent-region</P>-->
<P>The DENT library defines the functions indent-region and undent-region. indent-region indents the currently selected region by logical-tab-size characters. If provided with a prefix argument, it performs the indentation the specified numbers of times. undent-region undents the current region.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A name="edtsim"></A>EDTSIM, EDT Simulation</H2>

<!--<P><I><B>EDTSIM, EDT Simulation </B></I> EDTSIM EDT simulation</P>-->
<P>The EDTSIM package defines functions which emulate the EDT text editor found on the OpenVMS operating system from Digital Equipment Corporation.</P>

<P>When you load the EDTSIM library (using <KBD>ESC-x execute-mlisp-file edtsim</KBD>), the numeric keypad keys are re-bound to perform the same actions as they would in the real EDT editor. The major mode string in the mode line is modified to indicate that EDT simulation is loaded.</P>

<P>The following list contains all of the implemented EDT commands with a simple description of what each command does.</P>

<HR>
<H2><A name="incsearch"></A>INCSEARCH, Incremental Searching</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE><!--<P><I><B>INCSEARCH, Incremental Searching </B></I> INCSEARCH Incremental searching Searching, incremental</P>-->
<P>When you execute the normal Emacs search commands, you are prompted for the search string in the Mini-buffer. You type in the entire search string, press Return, and Emacs searches for the specified string. The INCSEARCH library defines functions which implement a different style of searching called incremental searching.</P>

<P>Incremental searches begin searching before you have finished typing the search string. As you type in the search string, Emacs moves the cursor to where the string would be found. When you have typed enough characters to identify the place you want, you can stop. Depending on what you will do next, you may or may not need to terminate the search explicitly with an RETURN.</P>

<P>Incremental searching is enabled by loading the INCSEARCH package. This package replaces the existing search commands with the following commands:</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><B>^F (incremental-search)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Performs a forwards incremental search.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><B>^R (reverse-incremental-search)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Performs a reverse incremental search.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<hr>
<P><B>inc-search-use-region 0</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Set variable inc-search-use-region to 1 to prevent incremental search from using the hilighted text 
as the default search string.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>The ^F command initiates a forwards incremental search. It reads in characters and positions the cursor at the first occurrence of the characters that you have typed. If you type ^F-F, the cursor moves right after the first F. Type an O, and the cursor moves to the first FO. After another O, the cursor is moved to the first occurrence of FOO. At the same time, the text FOO is echoed at the bottom of the screen.</P>

<P>If you type a incorrect character, you can rub it out. After the FOO, typing a Delete makes the last O disappear from the bottom of the screen, leaving only FO. The cursor moves back to the first occurrence of FO. If you delete the next O and the F, the cursor moves back to where you started the search.</P>

<P>When you are satisfied with the place you have reached, you can type a RETURN, which stops the search, leaving the cursor where the search brought it. Also, any command not meaningful in incremental searches stops the searching and is then executed. Thus, typing HOME would exit the search and then move to the beginning of the line. RETURN is necessary only if the next command you want to type is a printing character, Delete, RETURN, ^Q, or another search command, since those are the characters that have special meanings inside the search.</P>

<P>Sometimes you may search for FOO and find it, but not the one you expected to find. Type another ^F and the cursor will find the next FOO. This can be done any number of times. If you overshoot, you can rub out the unwanted ^F commands and the cursor will move back to the previous occurrences of the string.</P>

<P>If your string is not found at all, the message Failing I-Search is displayed in the Mini-buffer. The cursor is placed where Emacs found as much of your string as was possible. For example, if you search for FOOT, and there is no FOOT, you might see the cursor after the FOO (if the text FOO exists). At this point there are several things you can do. If your string was mis-typed, you can rub some of it out and correct it. If you like the place you have found, you can type a RETURN or some other Emacs command to accept what the search found.</P>

<P>The ^R command starts a reverse incremental search. This works in exactly the same way as the forward incremental search command, but in the opposite direction.</P>

<P>
If you highlighted some text in the buffer and then start incremental search the text is used as the default string to search for.
</P>
<P>For example hightlight FOO in the buffer, type ^F to start incremental search.
 Notice that the prompt is now "forward I-search [FOO]: " showing that FOO is the default string to search for.
 Type ^F again to find the next FOO.

<P>To use the MOUSE library functions, add the following MLisp code to your EMACSINIT.ML:</P>

<P>(load "mouse")</P>

<P>(mouse-mode) mouse-on</P>

<P>With the MOUSE library loaded, you can turn on mouse support with the mouse-on function. mouse-on takes one argument which is a number describing the required mouse cursor. A value of 0 (the default) specifies the default mouse cursor. A value of 1 specifies a cross-hair cursor (the cross-hair cursor is supported only on VWS workstations).</P>

<P>When Emacs mouse handling is enabled, you do not have access to the workstation cut and paste features. To use workstation cut and paste with Emacs, you must disable Emacs mouse handling using the mouse-off function. When you want to use Emacs mouse handling again, re-execute the mouse-on function.</P>

<P>The easiest way to have mouse support enabled whenever you enter Emacs is to execute mouse-on from the enter-emacs-hook and return-to-emacs-hook functions.

<H3>Position cursor</H3>

<P>Move the pointer to the position you wish to locate the cursor and click MB1. In overstrike mode, spaces (but not newlines) are inserted when needed to reach the selected position. In insert mode, no spaces are inserted, the cursor is placed at the end of the selected line.</P>

<H3>Select window</H3>

<P>Move the pointer to the mode line of the window you wish to select, and click MB1.</P>

<H3>Scroll window, vertical</H3>

<P>Grab part of the text by pointing to it with the pointer and pressing MB1. Move the mouse up or down to the position you would like the grabbed line to appear, then release MB1. The text is scrolled by a corresponding distance.</P>

<H3>Scroll window, horizontal</H3>

<P>Grab part of the mode line with MB1 and move the mouse left or right. Release with the pointer still on the mode line. The window will be panned to the left or right a corresponding distance.</P>

<H3>Change window size</H3>

<P>To make a window taller, shorter, narrower, or wider, grab the window's mode line, a vertical window border, or their intersection point, with MB1. Move the pointer to the new location of the mode line or border, and release MB1. Windows are deleted, if needed, to make room for the new window size.</P>

<H3>Execute keyboard macro</H3>

<P>A double-click of MB1 positions the cursor at the selected location, and then executes the current keyboard macro at that location.</P>

<H3>Copy region to Kill buffer</H3>

<P>A click of MB2 copies the text from the current location of dot to the selected position into the Kill buffer. The cursor position remains as selected with the mouse. Moving the mouse between the press and release of MB2 will perform the same scroll/pan/resize functions as with MB1.</P>

<H3>Kill region to Kill buffer</H3>

<P>A double-click of MB2 kills the text from the current location of dot to the selected position into the Kill buffer.</P>

<H3>Yank region from Kill buffer</H3>

<P>A double-click of MB3 yanks the Kill buffer into the selected position. If you click on the mode line, the yank is performed at the current location of dot in the selected window. A single click of MB3 performs the same functions as MB1. Moving the mouse between the press and release of MB3 performs the same scroll/pan/resize functions as MB1.</P>

<P>By default, MOUSE uses the standard Kill buffer handling routines for performing cut and paste operations. If you are using a modified version of cut and paste, or some kind of kill ring library, you can communicate this to the mouse library by setting the favorite-... series of global variables defined by the MOUSE library. These are:</P>

<H3>favorite-set-mark</H3>

<P>A string variable containing the name of the function the MOUSE library should use to set the mark. This is set-mark by default.</P>

<H3>favorite-kill-region</H3>

<P>A string variable containing the name of the function the MOUSE library should use to kill the region to the Kill buffer. This is delete-to-killbuffer by default.</P>

<H3>favorite-copy-region</H3>

<P>A string variable containing the name of the function the MOUSE library should use to copy the region to the Kill buffer. This is copy-to-killbuffer by default (a function defined by the MOUSE library).</P>

<P>A string variable containing the name of the function the MOUSE library should use to yank the contents of the Kill buffer into the current buffer. This is yank-from-killbuffer by default. KILLER, With the MOUSE library</P>

<P><A href="#examplekillermouse">The example</A> shows how to set these variables so that the KILLER cut and paste routines can be used with the MOUSE library. KILLER is described in <A href="#killer">KILLER, A Kill Ring System</A>.</P>

<P>When you use the mouse to scroll or pan windows, the default behaviour is for the scroll or pan to occur when the mouse button is released.

<H2><A name="mlispprogrammingwithmouse"></A>Mlisp Programming with the Mouse</H2>

<P>To write MLisp code with a mouse interface, you must write a mouse action function in MLisp, then bind the function to a mouse button sequence. Pressing that mouse button sequence will then invoke the mouse action function.</P>

<P>The general scheme for a mouse action function is as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Declare local variables mousex, mousey, mouseevent and mouse-second-click. These are set by the mouse-parameters function to reflect the results of the most recent mouse click.</LI>

<LI>Execute the mouse-parameters function to set mousex to column, mousey to row, mouseevent to a code which indicates which button was used and whether it was pressed or released. mouse-second-click is a mouse-click counter, and is set to 1 on the second click if you double-click a mouse button.</LI>

<LI>Execute the MLisp line (mouse-reposition mousex mousey mouseevent)to position the cursor. mouse-reposition also performs parts of the mode-line and scrolling operations when necessary.</LI>

<P>Pastes the previously-cut text into the buffer at dot in replace mode (overstrike-mode set to 1).</P>

<P>The following convenience functions are also defined:</P>

<H3>rect-cut-space</H3>

<P>Performs a rectangular cut with replace-with-white-space set to 1.</P>

<H3>rect-cut</H3>

<P>Performs a rectangular paste with overstrike-mode set to 1.</P>

<P>To cut a rectangular area from the buffer, move the cursor to one corner of the area to be cut and press GOLD-Select. Then move to the opposite corner and press either Remove or GOLD-Remove. Tabs replaced by spaces in the cut area.</P>

<P>When you cut a rectangular area where one of the corners is a space character, the highlighted space may remain highlighted after the cut operation is completed. To remove the highlighting, type ^L(redraw-display) and Emacs will redraw the display with the highlighting removed.</P>

<P>To paste a previously cut area back into the buffer, move the cursor to the desired location and type either Insert Here or GOLD-Insert Here. White-space at the ends of lines affected by the rectangular paste will first be removed.</P>

<P>Here are some examples:</P>

<P>Remove --- removes the area and the text moves to to fill the hole:</P>

<P>aaaaaaaaabb aaaaaaaaabb</P>

<P>aaaaaaaaabb -------&gt; aabb</P>

<P><B>How to Make a Tag Table for a Program</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To use the TAGS package, you must create a tag table from the source file or files in your program. Normally, the tag table does not reside in any of these files, but in a separate tag table file which contains the names of the text files which it describes. Tag table files are generated using the <KBD>ESC-x make-tag-table command</KBD>. make-tag-table asks you to specify the names of the files you wish to tag (which may contain wildcards), then proceeds to read all the files matching that file specification into Emacs. It then uses a set of built-in rules to tag the lines according to the source language. TAGS selects the language based on the file's extension. TAGS has built-in rules for building tag tables for the following languages:</P>

<P>&middot; MLisp</P>

<P>&middot; C, C++</P>

<P>&middot; Python</P>

<P>&middot; BLISS, BLISS-16, BLISS-32</P>

<P>&middot; RUNOFF</P>

<P>&middot; MACRO-32</P>

<P>&middot; FORTRAN. set-tag-language</P>

<P>If the language you wish to tag does not have built-in rules, you will have to teach TAGS how to recognise the lines to be tagged by using the <KBD>ESC-x set-tag-language</KBD> command. This command asks for a file type for the language and a regular expression search string to use to select lines to be tagged. Only one extra language can be specified; multiple calls of set-tag-language overwrite previous language specifications. recompute-all-tags</P>

<P>Once a tag table file exists, you must update it if you add new tags to the source files, or change the files extensively. You can do this by using the command <KBD>ESC-x recompute-all-tags</KBD>. TAGS finds the names and languages of the source files by reading the old tag table.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<H2><A name="howusetags"></A>How to Tell Emacs You Want to Use TAGS</H2>

<P>Before you can use the TAGS package, you have to load the library using the <KBD>ESC-x execute-mlisp-file</KBD> command. visit-tag-table</P>

<P>Before you can access a particular tag, you have to tell TAGS the name of the tag table file you want to use. This is done with the command <KBD>ESC-x visit-tag-table</KBD>. TAGS can only know about one tag table file at a time; executing a second <KBD>ESC-x visit-tag-table</KBD> command will overwrite any existing tag table (including any changes you may have made to it).</P>

<P>If no tag table has been specified and you attempt to find a tag, Emacs will read in the default tag table called SYS$DISK:[]TAGS.TAG.</P>

<P>visit-tag-table is essentially equivalent to selecting the buffer *TAGS* (which is where the tags live) and visiting the tag table file in that buffer, then returning to the previously selected buffer. After execution of visit-tag-table, <KBD>ESC-x list-buffers</KBD> will show the buffer *TAGS* visiting the tag table file.</P>

<HR>
<P><B>Jumping to a Tag</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To jump to the definition of a tagged item, use the command <KBD>^X-^L</KBD> (goto-tag). You will go straight to the definition of the tag you want. If the definition is in a different file, TAGS will visit that file and locate the tag. If it is in the same file, TAGS moves dot to the appropriate place.</P>

<P>You do not need to type the complete name of the tag to be found; any substring will do. If you use this feature, you may not always find the tag you expected; when this happens, <KBD>^U-^X-^L</KBD> will find the next definition matching the tag substring. For example, if you want to find the definition of X-SET-TYPE-1 and you specify just TYPE-1, you might find X-READ-TYPE-1 instead. You could then type <KBD>^U-^X-^L</KBD> until you reach X-SET-TYPE-1.</P>

<HR>
<P><B><I>Adding a New Function to a Tag Table </I></B> add-tag</P>-->
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When you define a new function, its location does not go in the tag table automatically. This is because Emacs cannot tell that you have defined a function unless you tell it by invoking the command <KBD>^X-^A</KBD> (add-tag).</P>

<P>When you type the command <KBD>^X-^A</KBD>, dot should be on the line that introduces the function definition. Thus, in a Lisp program, you might type (defun (foo) and then type <KBD>^X-^A</KBD> to define a tag for the foo function.</P>

<P>add-tag modifies only the copy of the tag table loaded into Emacs. To modify the tag table file itself, you must save the tag table to disk. <KBD>^X-^M</KBD> (write-modified-files) is the easiest way to do this.</P>

<P>Although local modifications to a file do not degrade the efficiency of the TAGS package or require that the tag table be rebuilt, moving a function a great distance makes finding that function much slower. In this case, you can add the function to the tag table with <KBD>^X-^A</KBD> to give the table its new location. Alternatively, you can run recompute-all-tags to update everything, as is usually done.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<H2><A name="vistingafunction"></A>Visiting a Function</H2>

<P>The command <KBD>ESC-x visit-function</KBD> can be used to temporarily view a function in another window. Type the function's name in the buffer, then execute visit-function. The function's name is extracted from the buffer and used as a tag to find. Before the tag is located, TAGS enters a recursive edit, so that when you have finished viewing the function, your original windows and buffers are re-displayed.</P>

<H3>Finding Out What Has Been Tagged</H3>

<!--<P><I><B>Finding Out What Has Been Tagged </B></I> list-tags</P>-->
<P>The function list-tags can be used to list the files and functions that have been tagged for any tag table. Just load the tag table and call the function. When you use make-tag-table, the list-tags function is automatically called so that you can see exactly what TAGS has tagged.</P>

<H3>Replacing Strings in a Tagged Program</H3>

<!--<P><I><B>Replacing Strings in a Tagged Program </B></I> tag-replace-string tag-query-replace-string</P>-->
<P>Two functions can be used to change all occurrences of a string in a set of files that have been tagged: tag-replace-string and tag-query-replace-string. Both of these functions require a regular expression search string and a replacement string as arguments, and apply the appropriate replace commands to all of the files tagged in the tag table.</P>

<H3>Applying MLisp to Lines in a Tagged Program</H3>

<!--<P><I><B>Applying MLisp to Lines in a Tagged Program </B></I> tag-execute-mlisp</P>-->
<P>A more flexible approach to multiple file editing is provided by the function tag-execute-mlisp. This function requires a regular expression search string which is used to find lines in all the files specified in the tag table. For all of the lines that match the pattern, the function sets dot to the found line, and executes a specified MLisp expression at that location.</P>

</PRE>

<P>where:
<BR>
<CODE>filename</CODE> is the file name and file type of the file for which the following lines are tag information.
