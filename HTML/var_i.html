<blockquote>
<p>Emacs can operate in two different input modes, traditional and GUI.</p>

<p>In GUI mode Emacs operates the highlight region in the style of Windows and Motif, a more intuitive mode.</p>

<p>The region will be set if you move the cursor while holding the shift key.</p>

<p>Typing or otherwise inserting text while the region is set will erase the region first. In effect replacing region with new text.</p>

<p>Using a delete command will erase the region rather then doing the normal delete action. delete commands includes, but is not limited to: delete-next-character, delete-next-word, delete-previous-character, delete-previous-word, erase-region.</p>

<p>Setting the mark manually, using the set-mark command, will temporarily disable the GUI input mode.</p>
