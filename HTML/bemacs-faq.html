<h1>Barry's Emacs FAQ</h1>

<p>This version dated 07-July-2002 and is maintained by
<a href="mailto:barry@barrys-emacs.org">Barry A. Scott, barry@barrys-emacs.org</a>.</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<h3>Why should I choose Barry's Emacs?</h3>

<p>Barry's Emacs is easy to use and accessable yet powerful.</p>
<p>You can start using Barry's Emacs as a notepad replacement.
Then, at your own speed use more advanced features.</p>
<p>Its user interface uses familiar Windows style user interface,
key bindings, menus, toolbar and dialogs. Barry's Emacs is integrated with the
windows explorer.</p>

<p>Contrast this with GNU Emacs that uses a quirky user interface,
non Windows key bindings and requires configuration in its ELisp language
before being useful.
</p>

<h3>Which Operating Systems are supported?</h3>
<p>There are three Barry's Emacs kits.</p> 
<ul>
<li>Barry's Emacs for Windows.
Supports Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP.
<li>Barry's Emacs for FreeBSD.
<li>Barry's Emacs for Linux.
</ul>                           

<h3>Is Barry's Emacs based on GNU Emacs?</h3>

<p>No. Barry's Emacs has been in existence in one form or another since
1980, GNU Emacs came along a few years later.
</p>

<h3>Can I get the source of Barry's Emacs?</h3>
<p>The source of all the MLisp extensions is included in each kit.</p>
<p>However the source code of the main editor is not available.</p>

<h2>User Interface</h2>

<h3>How do I use Ctrl-X for Cut and Emacs Ctrl-X commands?</h3>

<p>Traditionally Emacs like editors use Ctrl-X as a
keyboard command prefix. This conflicts with the normal use
of Ctrl-X as the Cut operation.
</p>
<p>By default Barry's Emacs allows both uses of Ctrl-X. If you
have highlighted a selection Ctrl-X will Cut it into the clip
board. Otherwise Barry's Emacs uses the Ctrl-X as a first key
of a Ctrl-X command.
</p>
<p>To add the default behaviour to your emacsinit.ml place the following
line at the top of the file.</p>
<pre>
(default-emacs-init "windows,windows-extended")
</pre>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<h3>What languages can I program Barry's Emacs in?</h3>
<p>Barry's Emacs is usually programmed in MLisp, its own
simplified version of Lisp.</p>
<p>On Windows Emacs can be extended by writting DLL's using
the Barry's Emacs extension API.
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> language can
also be used to program Barry's EMacs. However the Python
integration with Barry's Emacs is still experimental.
</p>

<h2>Itergating Emacs with other tools</h2>

<h3>Visual Studio V6</h3>

<p>This is how to add Barry's Emacs to the Visual Studio Tools menu.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the "Tools" menu select "Customize..."
<li>Select the "Tools" tab in the customize dialog.
<li>Add a new command "&amp;Barry's Emacs"<br>
Command: c:\Program Files\Barry Scott\Barry's Emacs\bemacs.exe<br>
Arguments: +$(CurLine) "$(FilePath)"
</ol>

<p>Now type ALT-T-B to have BEmacs edit the current file from Visual Studio.</p>

<h3>Configuring WinGrep to use BEmacs as the editor.</h3>

<p>	Use the     following     command     line     in     the
	Options/Preferences... dialog box.</p>

<pre>"C:\Program Files\Barry Scott\Barry's Emacs\BEmacs.exe" /package=wingrep $f $l</pre>

<p>Create the file emacs_user:wingrep.mlp with the following
	contents:</p>

<pre>
(defun
    (wingrep-com
	(visit-file (argv 1))
	(goto-line (argv 2))
    )
)
</pre>

<h3>Configuring SourceSafe to use BEmacs as the editor</h3>

<p>The vss-view package support SourceSafe Edit and View operations.</p>
<p>This package is automatically run from the vss-view.exe program.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start SourceSafe
<li>From the "Tools" menu select "Options..."
<li>Set "Editor for viewing files:" to c:\Program Files\Barry Scott\Barry's Emacs\vss-view.exe
<li>Set "Folder for temporary files:" to c:\temp
</ol>


<p>You will also need to edit your SS.INI file to allow overridden file types to use
vss-view.exe.</p>

<p>Here are some example lines for SS.INI</p>

<pre>
; The following lines force SourceSafe not to execute certain file types.
.reg = c:\Program Files\Barry Scott\Barry's Emacs\vss-view.exe
.vbp = c:\Program Files\Barry Scott\Barry's Emacs\vss-view.exe
.vcp = c:\Program Files\Barry Scott\Barry's Emacs\vss-view.exe
.mak = c:\Program Files\Barry Scott\Barry's Emacs\vss-view.exe
.bat = c:\Program Files\Barry Scott\Barry's Emacs\vss-view.exe
.cmd = c:\Program Files\Barry Scott\Barry's Emacs\vss-view.exe
.py  = c:\Program Files\Barry Scott\Barry's Emacs\vss-view.exe
</pre>
