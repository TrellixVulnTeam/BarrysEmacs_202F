<p><a name="pop-up-windows"></a><b>pop-up-windows</b> &laquo; 1</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Controls window pop-ups. If non-zero, Emacs will try to use a window other than the current window when it spontaneously generates a buffer that it wants you to see, or when you visit a file. If set to zero, the current window is always used.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a name="prefix-argument"></a><b>prefix-argument</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every function invocation is always prefixed by a numeric argument, either explicitly with prefix-argument or implicitly with provide-prefix-argument. The value of the variable prefix-argument is the argument prefixed to the invocation of the current MLisp function.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a name="prefix-argument-provided"></a><b>prefix-argument-provided</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If non-zero, a prefix argument has been provided for the current function. The value of prefix-argument-provided can be obtained from the prefix-argument variable.</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="prefix-string"></a><b>prefix-string</b> &laquo;</p>

</blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a name="previous-directory"></a><b>previous-directory</b> &laquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This variable is used by Barry's Emacs as part of support its bemacs command line interface to the bemacs_server process.</p>

<p>Each time Barry's Emacs starts to process a new command line the current directory is recorded in the previous-directory variable.</p>

<p>Once the command line process finishes Emacs automatically sets the current directory to the value held in previous-directory.</p>

<p>The command line processing MLisp code can cause Emacs's current directory to change by setting previous-directory to a suitable directory.</p>

<p>The MLisp Programmers Guide has furthur information about <a href="Z" onmouseover="return top.bemacs.mouseOver()" onclick="return top.bemacs.loadDocument(&#39;pg&#39;,&#39;#commandlines&#39;)">Command Lines</a>. Including how to customise command line handling.</p>
