<p><a name="pop-up-windows"></a><b>pop-up-windows</b> &#171; 1</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Controls window pop-ups. If non-zero, Emacs will try to use a window other than the current window when it spontaneously generates a buffer that it wants you to see, or when you visit a file. If set to zero, the current window is always used.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="prefix-argument"></a><b>prefix-argument</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every function invocation is always prefixed by a numeric argument, either explicitly with prefix-argument or implicitly with provide-prefix-argument. The value of the variable prefix-argument is the argument prefixed to the invocation of the current MLisp function.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="prefix-argument-provided"></a><b>prefix-argument-provided</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If non-zero, a prefix argument has been provided for the current function. The value of prefix-argument-provided can be obtained from the prefix-argument variable.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="prefix-string"></a><b>prefix-string</b> &#171;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contains the string that is inserted after an automatic newline has been generated in response to moving the cursor past the right margin. This is generally used by the language-dependent commenting features.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="previous-directory"></a><b>previous-directory</b> &#171;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This variable is used by Barry's Emacs as part of support its bemacs command line interface to the bemacs_server process.</p>

<p>Each time Barry's Emacs starts to process a new command line the current directory is recorded in the previous-directory variable.</p>

<p>Once the command line process finishes Emacs automatically sets the current directory to the value held in previous-directory.</p>

<p>The command line processing MLisp code can cause Emacs's current directory to change by setting previous-directory to a suitable directory.</p>

<p>The <a href="mlisp_programmers_guide.html">MLisp Programmer's Guide</a> has furthur information about Command Lines. Including how to customise command line handling.</p>

<p><a name="process-key-hook"></a><b>process-key-hook</b> &#171;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This buffer-specific variable holds the name of a function to call after each keymap command. last-keys-struck holds the string of keys that invoked the last command.</p>
