</blockquote>


<p><a name="checkpoint-frequency"></a><b>checkpoint-frequency</b> &#171; 0</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contains the number of keystrokes between checkpoints. Every checkpoint-frequency keystrokes, all buffers which have been modified since they were last checkpointed and that have checkpointing enabled are written to disk. If the value is zero, checkpointing is disabled.</p>

<p><a name="checkpoint-hook"></a><b>checkpoint-hook</b> &#171; checkpoint-buffers</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contains the name of an Emacs function which will be called when the checkpoint function is invoked. The checkpoint function should in some way checkpoint Emacs.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="cli-name"></a><b>cli-name</b> &#171; The name of the CLI that started Emacs</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Indicates the name of the CLI that invoked Emacs. The contents of this variable are used to tell subprocesses which CLI to use. You can alter its value to start a subprocess with a different CLI.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="comment-column"></a><b>comment-column</b> &#171; 33</p>

<p><a name="confirm-expansion-choice"></a><b>confirm-expansion-choice</b> &#171; 0</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This variable changes the way that Emacs input completion logic works.</p>

<p>When confirm-expansion-choice is true emacs will always prompt once more after expanding a unique input choice. It confirm-expansion-choice is false emacs will take the unique choice and use it with out further prompts.</p>

<p><a name="control-string-convert-F-keys"></a><b>control-string-convert-F-keys</b> &#171; 1</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When control-string-convert-F-keys is true, the keys F6 to F20 and E1 to E6 are converted on input to a compact form. This improves Emacs' performance in a number of ways -- less memory used to store keymaps, and keyboard-handling uses less CPU time.</p>

<p>Before conversion the control sequence is:</p>

<p>CSI number ~</p>

<p>This is converted to CSI followed by one key whose value is 32 plus the above number.</p>

<p>See <a href="#control-string-processing">control-string-processing</a> for general information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When control-string-convert-mouse is true, all control sequences of the form:</p>

<p>CSI event;params... &amp;w</p>

<p>are converted into \201 followed by one character which is the event number plus A.</p>

<p>See <a href="#control-string-processing">control-string-processing</a> for general information.</p>

<p><a name="control-string-processing"></a><b>control-string-processing</b> &#171; 1</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The master control for all the control string functions. Only when control-string-processing is true will any processing be performed.</p>

<p>control-string-processing changes the behaviour of a number of parts of Emacs:</p>

<ul>
<li>All keystrokes are compressed and processed according to the control-string variables.</li>

<li>bind-to-key and local-bind-to-key will use the control-string variables to compress their &lt;keys&gt;key sequences.</li>

<li>describe-bindings, describe-key and apropos-commands will use the built-in keyname table to print the names of keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The values of the control-string...variables must only be changed in the file |<span class="cmd">emacs_control_strings.ml</span>. If you wish to change any of these variables, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a copy of <span class="cmd">emacs_library:emacs_control_strings.ml</span> in your <span class="cmd">emacs_path:</span></li>

<li>Rebuild your Emacs environment.</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="ctlchar-with-^"></a><b>ctlchar-with-^</b> &#171; 0</p>

<p>Controls the way that non-printing characters are displayed. If non-zero, control characters are printed with a leading up-arrow, otherwise they are printed as an octal number.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-breakpoint"></a><b>current-breakpoint</b> &#171;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This read-only variable contains the name of the function that caused the breakpoint function to run. This variable is not altered from MLisp in a trace or breakpoint function.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-buffer-abbrev-table"></a><b>current-buffer-abbrev-table</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contains the name of te current buffer's abbreviation table. If you attempt to assign a value to it, the current buffer's abbreviation table is changed; the name you supply must be the name of an already-existing abbreviation table.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-buffer-allocation-size"></a><b>current-buffer-allocation-size</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When read current-buffer-allocation-size returns the size in characters allocated for use in the current buffer.</p>

<p>Assigning a new, larger, value to current-buffer-allocation-size will increase the capacity of the current buffer.</p>

<p>It is not normally nessesary to use this variable. However as a performance enhancement it is sometimes useful.</p>

<p>If you plan to perform a complex set of operations on a buffer. These operations will cause the buffer to slowly grow to a much larger size. Assigning to current-buffer-allocation-size a suitable large value will reduce the CPU overhead of expanding the buffer is many small increments.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-buffer-checkpointable"></a><b>current-buffer-checkpointable</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defines whether or not the current buffer is checkpointable. If non-zero, when a checkpoint occurs, the buffer will be checkpointed if it has been modified. Otherwise, the buffer will not be checkpointed.</p>

<p>A buffer can never be checkpointed if the checkpoint-frequency variable is set to zero.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-buffer-file-name"></a><b>current-buffer-file-name</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contains the full file specification of the file associated with the current buffer. If the file does not already exist, the version number is omitted.</p>

<p>Setting this variable sets the filename to which the buffer is connected, but does not write the file. Also, the buffer is forced to be a File buffer.</p>

<p>If the buffer is not a File buffer, a null string is returned.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-buffer-journalled"></a><b>current-buffer-journalled</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Controls whether the current buffer is journalled. If set to true, the buffer will be journalled.</p>

</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-buffer-macro-name"></a><b>current-buffer-macro-name</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contains the macro name associated with the current buffer.</p>

<p>Setting this variable sets the macro to which this buffer is connected. The buffer will be coerced into a Macro buffer.</p>

<p>If this buffer is not a Macro buffer, a null string is returned.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-buffer-name"></a><b>current-buffer-name</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contains the name of the currently selected buffer. You can change the name of the current buffer by assigning a new name to the variable. The new buffer name must not already exist.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-buffer-end-of-line-style"></a><b>current-buffer-end-of-line-style</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contains the end-of-line style of the file associated with the current buffer.
The variable is one of variable, "crlf", "lf". The default value for new buffers is taken from the default-buffer-end-of-line-style variable.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-buffer-RMS-record-attribute"></a><b>current-buffer-RMS-record-attribute</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We recommend you use the variable current-buffer-end-of-line-style to set the end-of-line style rather then use
the RMS variables.</p> 
<p>Contains the RMS record attribute of the file associated with the current buffer.
The variable is one of variable, stream, stream-lf, or stream-cr.
The default value for new buffers is taken from the default-buffer-RMS-record-attribute variable.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-buffer-syntax-table"></a><b>current-buffer-syntax-table</b> &#171;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contains the name of the current buffer's syntax table. Assigning to this variable changes the current buffer's syntax table. The specified syntax table must already exist.</p>

</blockquote>


<p><a name="current-local-keymap"></a><b>current-local-keymap</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contains the name of the current buffer's local keymap as set by the use-local-map function. Assigning the variable has the same effect as executing use-local-map. An existing keymap must be specified.</p>
