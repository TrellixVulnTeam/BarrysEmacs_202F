<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Contains the number of keystrokes between checkpoints. Every checkpoint-frequency keystrokes, all buffers which have been modified since they were last checkpointed and that have checkpointing enabled are written to disk. If the value is zero, checkpointing is disabled.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="control-string-convert-F-keys"></A><B>control-string-convert-F-keys</B> &laquo; 1</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When control-string-convert-F-keys is true, the keys F6 to F20 and E1 to E6 are converted on input to a compact form. This improves Emacs' performance in a number of ways -- less memory used to store keymaps, and keyboard-handling uses less CPU time.</P>

<P>Before conversion the control sequence is:</P>

<P>CSI number ~</P>

<P>This is converted to CSI followed by one key whose value is 32 plus the above number.</P>

<P>See <A href="#control-string-processing">control-string-processing</A> for general information.</P>

<P><A name="control-string-processing"></A><B>control-string-processing</B> &laquo; 1</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The master control for all the control string functions. Only when control-string-processing is true will any processing be performed.</P>

<P>control-string-processing changes the behaviour of a number of parts of Emacs:</P>

<UL>
<LI>All keystrokes are compressed and processed according to the control-string variables.</LI>

<LI>bind-to-key and local-bind-to-key will use the control-string variables to compress their &lt;keys&gt;key sequences.</LI>

<LI>describe-bindings, describe-key and apropos-commands will use the built-in keyname table to print the names of keys.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Note: The values of the control-string...variables must only be changed in the file |<CODE>emacs_control_strings.ml</CODE>. If you wish to change any of these variables, do the following:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Make a copy of <CODE>emacs$library:emacs_control_strings.ml</CODE> in your <CODE>emacs$path:</CODE></LI>

<LI>Rebuild your Emacs environment.</LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When read current-buffer-allocation-size returns the size in characters allocated for use in the current buffer.</P>

<P>Assigning a new, larger, value to current-buffer-allocation-size will increase the capacity of the current buffer.</P>

<P>It is not normally nessesary to use this variable. However as a performance enhancement it is sometimes useful.</P>

<P>If you plan to perform a complex set of operations on a buffer. These operations will cause the buffer to slowly grow to a much larger size. Assigning to current-buffer-allocation-size a suitable large value will reduce the CPU overhead of expanding the buffer is many small increments.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="current-buffer-checkpointable"></A><B>current-buffer-checkpointable</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="current-buffer-file-name"></A><B>current-buffer-file-name</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Contains the macro name associated with the current buffer.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="current-buffer-name"></A><B>current-buffer-name</B></P>
