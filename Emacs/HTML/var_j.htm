<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sets the time in seconds before any journal files are flushed to disk. A reasonable value for this variable is 30 seconds. To disable journalling, set this variable to 0 or false.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="journal-scratch-buffers"></A><B>journal-scratch-buffers</B> &laquo; 0</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>By default Emacs will not journal scratch buffers, even when current-buffer-journalled is 1. This is normally a good thing as its improves the performance of Emacs. Many packages use scratch buffers which would be journalled if this variable was set to 1.</P>

<P>Set this variable to 1 will enable journalling on all buffers.</P>
