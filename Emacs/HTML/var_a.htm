<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Holds the expansion of the abbreviation when an abbreviation hook function is called. At all other times it contains a null string.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="abbrev-mode"></A><B>abbrev-mode</B> &laquo; 0</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Controls whether abbreviations are expanded. If set to true, abbreviations are checked and expanded as required, otherwise, no expansion takes place. This variable is buffer-specific and its state is displayed in the mode line of each window.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="activity-indicator"></A><B>activity-indicator</B> &laquo; 0</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Controls the activity indicator. The activity indicator is a single letter code that is displayed at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. The various codes are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>x -- indicates that Emacs is initialising</LI>

<LI>i -- indicates that Emacs is waiting for input</LI>

<LI>b -- indicates that Emacs is busy working</LI>

<LI>c -- indicates that Emacs is checkpointing</LI>

<LI>c -- indicates that Emacs is journalling</LI>
</UL>

<P>To make room for the activity indicator, the Mini-buffer is moved over two columns to the right.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="animated-journal-recovery"></A><B>animated-journal-recovery</B> &laquo; 0</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When set to true, the journal-recovercommand will update the screen while recovering the contents of a buffer. If animated-journal-recovery is false, the screen is updated after all the journal has been used to recover the buffer.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="ask-about-buffer-names"></A><B>ask-about-buffer-names</B> &laquo; 1</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Controls what the visit-file function does if the buffer name it constructs is already in use. If it is non-zero, Emacs will ask for a new buffer name, or for Return to be typed which will overwrite the old buffer. If the variable is zero, a buffer name will be created by appending <CODE>n</CODE> to the buffer name, (where <CODE>n</CODE> is a unique sequence number).</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="ask-about-synchronise-for-none-modified-buffers"></A><B>ask-about-synchronise-for-none-modified-buffers</B> &laquo; 0</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Normally the synchronise-files commands always asks the user to confirm any change to a buffer.</P>

<P>If ask-about-synchronise-for-none-modified-buffers is 1 then synchronise-files will not ask for permission to delete or reread the contents of buffers that have not been modified.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="auto-fill-hook"></A><B>auto-fill-hook</B> &laquo; default-auto-fill-hook</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Controls the calling of a function to fill the current line. The variable is set to the name of the function to be called to fill the line, or the null string if no function is to be called.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="automatic-horizontal-scrolling"></A><B>automatic-horizontal-scrolling</B> &laquo; 0</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
