<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Controls window pop-ups. If non-zero, Emacs will try to use a window other than the current window when it spontaneously generates a buffer that it wants you to see, or when you visit a file. If set to zero, the current window is always used.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="prefix-argument"></A><B>prefix-argument</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Every function invocation is always prefixed by a numeric argument, either explicitly with prefix-argument or implicitly with provide-prefix-argument. The value of the variable prefix-argument is the argument prefixed to the invocation of the current MLisp function.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="prefix-argument-provided"></A><B>prefix-argument-provided</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If non-zero, a prefix argument has been provided for the current function. The value of prefix-argument-provided can be obtained from the prefix-argument variable.</P>

<P><A name="previous-directory"></A><B>previous-directory</B> &laquo;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This variable is used by Barry's Emacs as part of support its bemacs command line interface to the bemacs_server process.</P>

<P>Each time Barry's Emacs starts to process a new command line the current directory is recorded in the previous-directory variable.</P>

<P>Once the command line process finishes Emacs automatically sets the current directory to the value held in previous-directory.</P>

<P>The command line processing MLisp code can cause Emacs's current directory to change by setting previous-directory to a suitable directory.</P>

<P>The MLisp Programmers Guide has furthur information about <A href="Z" onmouseover="return top.bemacs.mouseOver()" onclick="return top.bemacs.loadDocument(&#39;pg&#39;,&#39;#commandlines&#39;)">Command Lines</A>. Including how to customise command line handling.</P>
