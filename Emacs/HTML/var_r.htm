<HR>
<P><A name="read-only"></A><B>read-only</B> &laquo; -1</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The value of this constant is returned by the file-exists function to indicate that the target file is readable.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="read-only-buffer"></A><B>read-only-buffer</B>&laquo; 0</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Controls whether or not a buffer can be modified. When read-only-buffer is set to true, all attempts to modify the buffer will be ignored and will result in an error.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="read-write"></A><B>read-write</B> &laquo; 1</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The value of this constant is returned by the file-exists function to indicate that the target file can be read and written.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="remove-help-window"></A><B>remove-help-window</B> &laquo; 1</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Controls the removal of the help window. When non-zero, help windows that have been automatically popped up onto the screen are removed. Otherwise, the help window will stay on the screen after the help function has completed.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="replace-case"></A><B>replace-case</B> &laquo; 0</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Controls the case of replacement text. If non-zero, Emacs will alter the case of strings substituted with replace-string or query-replace-string to match the case of the original string.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="replace-mode"></A><B>replace-mode</B> &laquo; 0</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Controls the Replace minor mode. If non-zero, characters inserted into the buffer replace existing characters, rather then inserting (the default). This can be useful when editing diagrams.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="restored-environment"></A><B>restored-environment</B> &laquo; 0</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This read-only variable is a count of the number of times that the current environment has been saved and restored. If Emacs has not been restored from a saved environment file, restored-environment is zero.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="return-to-emacs-hook"></A><B>return-to-emacs-hook</B> &laquo;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Contains the name of an Emacs function which will be called when Emacs returns from DCL after a pause-emacs or return-to-monitor command. You can assign the name of any existing function to the variable.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<P><A name="right-margin"></A><B>right-margin</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Controls the right margin setting for automatic text justification. If a character is inserted at the end of a line to the right of right-margin, Emacs will automatically insert at the beginning of the preceding word a newline, tabs and spaces to indent to the left margin, and the prefix string. For example, with right-margin set to 72, you can type in a document without worrying about when to hit the Return key; Emacs will automatically do this for you at exactly the right place.</P>
