New in %(version)s
	New in this release

        * Improve XML mode and HTML modes

        * Improve Python mode

        * Disable python integration. Too compile bemacs MFC is required
          which I only have for VC 6.0.  Python 2.5 needs newer compiler
          that does not provide MFC unless I get the expensive version.

        * Fix crash with abbrev expansions.
