Mac OS notes
    There are some command line tools include on Barry's Emacs
    install disk. 

    * bemacs-cli is the command line version of bemacs.

    * bemacs_client is the command line client that can be used to start
      the Barry's Emacs Application.

    Copy these to a folder on your PATH, typically this is ~/bin.
