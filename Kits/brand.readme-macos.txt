Mac OS notes
    There are some command line tools included on Barry's Emacs
    install disk. 

    * bemacs-cli is the command line version of bemacs.
      Useful when you canno use the GUI version. For example
      when connected to a Mac via ssh or when using sudo.

    * bemacs_client is the command line client that can be used to start
      the Barry's Emacs Application from the command line.

    Copy these to a folder on your PATH, typically this is ~/bin.

    These tools assume you have installed Barry's Emacs into the
    /Applications folder.
